From 1858 to 1863 Gardner ran Brady's Washington, D.C. gallery. At this time Gardner was using electric light to photograph. In 1863, Gardner left Brady's firm and decided to photograph the Civil War by himself. He photographed Abraham Lincoln at the Battle of Antietam. He also became the official photographer of the army of the Potomac. In 1863 Gardner opened his own studio in Washington, D.C. where he sold mainly stereographs. In 1865 Gardner did the reportage on Lincoln's assasination and funeral. In 1866 Gardner published \"Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the Civil War\". In 1867 he closed his Wahington studio and became the official photograher of the Union Pacific Railroad's Eastern Division. He photographed the construction of the railway to California, including the networks of Kansas, West Mississippi, and Missouri. During this time he also made portraits of American and Peruvian Indians. In 1868 he photographed the Fort Laramie Treaty Council. Gardner returned to Washington, D.C. in the 1870s where he operated a studio and photographed members of the Indian Treaty delegations.",

He was raised in California, studied at the Rhode Island School of Design, and received a BFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York City.Influenced by surrealist painter Giorgio de Chirico, Garet uses garish colors in jarring contrasts to explore relationships between nature, man, and art.  He combines human figures, classical architectural fragments and abstraction in narrative works, and is known for his amorphous life forms. Nothing Too Strange and Beautiful, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art demonstrates this phase of the artist's monumental sculpture.  It was originally created as a folly for a sculpture park exhibition at Wave Hill in New York City.  In later work, figures, trees and other more recognizable objects were added to the minimalist flat ground, creating tension.The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Honolulu Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art (New York City), the Phoenix Art Museum (Phoenix, Arizona), the Portland Art Museum (Portland, Oregon), the Tate Gallery (London), and the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York City) are among the public collections holding works by Jedd Garet.",
