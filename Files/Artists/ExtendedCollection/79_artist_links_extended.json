      "Introduction": "Carroll Cloar (January 18, 1913 \u2013 April 10, 1993) was a nationally known 20th-century painter born in Earle, Arkansas, who focused his work on surreal views of Southern U.S. themes and on poetically portraying childhood memories of natural scenery, buildings, and people, often working from old photographs found in his family albums.\nGuy Northrop, in his introduction on page 24 to Hostile Butterflies and Other Paintings by Carroll Cloar (1977), quoted Cloar describing his images as \"American faces, timeless dress and timeless customs ... the last of old America that isn't long for this earth.\" His Panther Bourne work depicted a surreal, Southern-mythic nature scene. Cloar employed pointillism in his painting \"Waiting up for Lettie,\" creating over 800 works in his lifetime.\nHe moved to Memphis in 1930, attending Southwestern at Memphis (later known as Rhodes College) as an English major. His recurrent themes of a \"homecoming,\" implying that the essential beauty of a locale is best understood by one who has left a beloved place behind and then returned, are echoed in his own personal experience of traveling abroad for years and then returning to the South. He began his travels in Europe after college, before returning to Memphis to study at Memphis College of Art. He studied at the Art Students League of New York from 1936 to 1940.\nA series of lithographs he created in that period of the landscape and people of his Earle, Arkansas, hometown led to his receipt of a McDowell Traveling Fellowship in 1940. Cloar traveled throughout the western United States and Mexico until World War II began. He then joined the Army Air Forces for the war effort.\nCloar visited Mexico on a 1946 Guggenheim Fellowship. He traveled around Central and South America until 1950. His first one-man show was held in 1953 in Memphis. He moved permanently to Memphis in 1955, after determining the direction of his art was rooted in his Southern U.S. experience.\nCloar then completed 14 works in 1955, including the representative work, \"My Father Was Big as a Tree.\" A New York showing in 1956 helped establish his career nationally. Tennessee museums later held more than 10 exhibitions of his works, while he also displayed his work in New York showings.\nCloar died in Memphis in 1993.",

      "Introduction": "Robert Myron Coates (April 6, 1897 \u2013 February 8, 1973) was an American novelist, short story writer and art critic. He published five novels; one classic historical work, The Outlaw Years (1930) which deals with the history of the land pirates of the Natchez Trace; a book of memoirs, The View from Here (1960), and two travel books, Beyond the Alps (1962) and South of Rome (1965). During his unusually varied career, Coates explored many different genres and styles of writing and produced three highly remarkable experimental novels, The Eater of Darkness (1926), Yesterday\u2019s Burdens (1933) and The Bitter Season (1946). Highly original and experimental, these novels draw upon expressionism, Dadaism and surrealism. His last two novels\u2014Wisteria Cottage (1948) and The Farther Shore (1955)\u2014are examples of crime fiction. Simultaneously to working as a novelist, Coates maintained a life-long career at the New Yorker, whose staff he joined in 1927. The magazine printed more than a hundred of his short stories many of which were collected in three anthologies; All the Year Round (1943), The Hour after Westerly (1957) and The Man Just ahead of You (1964). Also, from 1937 to 1967, Coates was the New Yorker\u2019s art critic and coined the term \u201cabstract expressionism\u201d in 1946 in reference to the works of Hans Hofmann, Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and others. He was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1958. Coates was married to sculptor Elsa Kirpal from 1927 to 1946. Their first and only child, Anthony Robertson Coates, was born on March 4, 1934. In 1946, they divorced and Coates married short story writer Astrid Meighan-Peters. He died of cancer of the throat in New York City on February 8, 1973.Anthony Boucher praised Coates as \"one of the most persuasive recorders of the unaccountable and disturbing moment,\" singling out his fantasy stories for their \"haunting tone of uncertainty and dislocation.\" Floyd C. Gale said that The Eater of Darkness \"has been called the first surrealist novel in English\".Maxim Lieber was Coates' literary agent from 1935 to 1938 and in 1941 and 1945.",
