Hayden studied engineering at the Warsaw Polytechnic from 1902 to 1905, while simultaneously pursuing studies at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts and eventually moved to France in 1907.In Paris, he became acquainted with the artists associated with the Ecole de Paris and later raised to prominence as a Cubist painter. Hayden said that \"I only absorbed Cubism in 1915, after having swallowed and digested all of French painting in a few years. This rapid absorption led me, in a spirit of creative synthesis, without even realising, to Picasso and Braque's experimentation at the time.\" His first exhibition took place at the Galerie Druet in 1911. One of Hayden's first dealers was Leonce Rosenberg, who organised an exhibition of his works in 1919.",

In 1889, he moved his studio to Saint Paul, Minnesota, and operated there until 1916. In 1897, Haynes opened another studio at the Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park, called \"Haynes' Log Cabin Studio\". From 1876 to 1905, Haynes was the official photographer of the Northern Pacific Railroad. In 1877, Haynes photographed the Dakota Territory from Bismark (now North Dakota) to Deadwood (now South Dakota). In 1878, Haynes travelled 3000 miles down the Missouri River and photographed from Bismark, Dakota Territory, to the Pacific coast. In 1881, Haynes visited Yellowstone National Park and returned to photograph the park every year until his death. In 1883, he accompanied President Chester A. Arthur's expedition through Yellowstone and photographed the driving of the last spike of the Northern Pacific Railroad. In 1884, Haynes became the sole photographic operator for Yellowstone, a position he held until 1921.",
