      "Introduction": "Patrick Scott (24 January 1921 \u2013 14 February 2014) was an Irish artist.\nPatrick Scott was born in Kilbrittain, County Cork, in 1921, and had his first exhibition in 1944, but trained as an architect and did not become a full-time artist until 1960. He worked for fifteen years for the Irish architect Michael Scott, assisting, for example, in the design of Bus\u00e1ras, the central bus station in Dublin. He was also responsible for the orange livery of Irish intercity trains.Scott was perhaps best known for his gold paintings, abstracts incorporating geometrical forms in gold leaf against a pale tempura background. He also produced tapestries and carpets.His paintings are in several important collections including the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He won the Guggenheim Award in 1960, represented Ireland in the 1960 Venice Biennale, the Douglas Hyde Gallery held a major retrospective of his work in 1981 and the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin held a major  survey in 2002. His works are distinguished by their purity and sense of calm, reflecting his own interest in Zen Buddhism.In October 2013, Scott wed his companion of 30 years, Eric Pearce, in a civil ceremony at the Dublin Registry Office.On 11 July 2007, Scott, who was a founding member of Aosd\u00e1na, was conferred with the title of Saoi, the highest honour that can be bestowed upon an Irish artist. The President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, made the presentation, placing a gold torc, the symbol of the office of Saoi, around his neck. No more than seven living members may hold this honour at any one time.Scott died on 14 February 2014 at the age of 93.  He was survived by his partner.\nIn January 2021 An Post issued a special stamp featuring Scott's work for the centenary of his birth.",

      "Introduction": "Tim Scott (born 1937, London) is a British sculptor known for his abstract sculptures made from transparent acrylic and steel. While studying architecture, Scott also studied sculpture part-time at Saint Martin's School of Art with Sir Anthony Caro, where he also later taught. Inspired by the example of David Smith, Scott began to make sculptures using materials such as fibreglass, glass, metal, and acrylic sheets.Scott was part of a group of young sculptors known as the 'New Generation', exhibiting together in London in the mid-1960s. In the 1970s, Scott created his groundbreaking series of thick-slab acrylic and steel sculptures. Frustrated ultimately with the fragility of plastics at the time, Scott switched to steel for his material, abandoning his trademark acrylic sheets altogether.His work can be found in many important collections, including 12 works at the Tate, London, and the Museum of Modern Art, New York City. His work is also held by the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum, Lisbon, the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Kunsthalle, Hamburg. He had solo shows in London at the Waddington Galleries in 1966 and the Whitechapel Gallery in 1967, at Kettle's Yard in Cambridge in 1980, at the Kunsthalle in Hamburg in 1981 and the Poussin Gallery in London in 2006. His sculptures have also been exhibited in group shows, including the Arts Council England touring exhibition Kaleidoscope: Colour and Sequence in 1960s British Art, which was at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in June 2017.He taught inter alia as a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Nuremberg.",
