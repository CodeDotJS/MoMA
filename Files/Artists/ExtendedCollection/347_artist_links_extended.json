Roh is perhaps best known for his 1925 book Nach-Expressionismus: Magischer Realismus: Probleme der neuesten europ\u00e4ischen Malerei (\"Post-expressionism: Magical Realism: Problems of the newest European painting\") he coined the term magic realism.\nRoh was born in Apolda (in present-day Thuringia), Germany. He studied at universities in Leipzig, Berlin, and Basel. In 1920, he received his Ph.D. in Munich for a work on Dutch paintings of the 17th century. As a photographer and critic, he absolutely hated photographs that mimicked painting, charcoal, or drawings. During the Nazi regime, he was isolated and briefly put in jail for his book Foto-Auge (Photo-Eye); he used his jail time he used to write the book Der Verkannte K\u00fcnstler: Geschichte und Theorie des kulturellen Mi\u00dfverstehens (\"The unrecognized artist: history and theory of cultural misunderstanding\"). After the war, in 1946, he married art historian Juliane Bartsch. He died in Munich.",
