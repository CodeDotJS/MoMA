      "Introduction": "British artist is associated with Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism. He is regarded as one of the most innovative printmakers of the 20th century, particularly in regard to his development of intaglio and color printmaking techniques, on which he published guides.  Born to a family of artists, he studied chemistry and geology and worked in the Middle East from 1922-1925 for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but decided to abandon this career for art. He settled in Paris in 1926 and in 1927 he founded a print shop in Paris with Joseph Hecht. The shop became known as Atelier 17, (called Atelier Contrepoint after Hayter's death in 1988). He worked there with many artists of the time, including Mir\u00f3, Arp, Tanguy, Giacometti, Matta, Brauner, Kandinsky, Alechinsky, and Andr\u00e9 Masson, with whom he explored automatic drawing. Between 1933 and 1950, Hayter relocated to New York where he was in contact with other European and American painters, including Pollock, Rothko, Motherwell, and Gorky.",

      "Introduction": "Best known for his politically-themed photomontage work of the 1930s lampooning the machinery of war and the rise of fascism. He studied at Munich's K\u00f6nigliche Kunstgewerbeschule with the Jugendstil poster artists Weisberger and Hohlwein, and later with Ernst Neumann, an advertising designer. The outbreak of World War I ended his studies in 1914. His earliest photo-based works involved juxtapositions of combat photographs with government war propaganda. He shared a studio with his friend, the painter George Grosz, and together they anglicized their names as a protest against the war. In 1918 he joined both the Berlin Dada movement and Germany's Communist Party. He designed book jackets for leftist literature at his brother's publishing house Malik Verlag, and from the mid-1920s his photomontages began to appear in left-wing periodicals. He is most noted for the satirical montages targeting Adolf Hitler and his followers that he created in the 1930s for the magazine AIZ (Die Arbeiter Illustrierte Zeitung).",
