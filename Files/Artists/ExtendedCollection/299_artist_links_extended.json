Working in a wide variety of mediums, his oeuvre is among the most diverse and prolific in all of modern art. He is best known for his series of paintings on legends from Australian history, most famously Ned Kelly, the bushranger and outlaw. Nolan's stylised depiction of Kelly's armour has become an icon of Australian art.",

The family ran the Norton & Co. of Lockport.  Norton's study of law at Harvard University was broken off when the family's firm went bankrupt.  Before, and after a period of living as a cowboy and enlisting with the Rough Riders, he studied art at the Art Institute of Chicago (1897, 1899\u20131901); he would later teach there. His students included Frances Badger. He was influenced by the Armory Show and the Japanese printmaker Katsushika Hokusai.\nAmong his works are the landmark 1929 180-foot (55\u00a0m) long ceiling mural for the concourse of the old Chicago Daily News Building (mural not currently installed in this building, which has been renamed Riverside Plaza; designed by architects Holabird & Root, 1929); the Ceres mural in the Chicago Board of Trade Building (Holabird & Root, 1930); two large murals, \"Old South\" and \"New South\" commissioned by Holabird & Root for the Jefferson County Courthouse in Birmingham, Alabama; his Tavern Club  murals at the 333 North Michigan Ave. building, Chicago  (Holabird & Root, 1928); his American Heritage Series at the Hamilton Park Field House, 513 W. 72nd St., Chicago; four murals at the St. Paul, Minnesota city hall; twelve murals comprising The History of Mankind (1923) at the Logan Museum of Anthropology at Beloit College, in Wisconsin; and his first major mural in Chicago's Cliff Dwellers Club (1909), where he was a founding member.\nAt the time of his death on January 7, 1934, in Charleston, South Carolina of cancer, he was a popular and respected artist.\nHe was survived by his wife and his three children, a son and two daughters.",
