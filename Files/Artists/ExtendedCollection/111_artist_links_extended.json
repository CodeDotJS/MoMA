      "Introduction": "Dubuffet began his career as a wine merchant, and did not devote himself completely to painting until the age of 41. He valued, collected, and emulated 'art brut,' a term he coined to describe work that is non-conformist, unprocessed, spontaneous, and insulated from all social and cultural influences. He was prolific and moved through figurative and abstract phases, arriving in 1962 at an invented style that he called Hourloupe, based on graphic black-lined cells painted in a restricted palette of mostly red, blue, and white. These were first paintings and drawings, but soon became sculptural, at times becoming monumental or environmental.",

    "details": {
      "Introduction": "French painter, sculptor, and theorist whose work and ideas have served as a starting point for a conceptual approach to art. By refusing to accept the standards and practices of the established art world, Duchamp redefined our understanding of what constitutes an art object. Duchamp was born into a family of artists, and by the age of 15, he turned to painting, executing a series of landscapes in the Impressionist style. From 1910, Duchamp emulated the structural compositions and brushstrokes of C\u00e9zanne, and used an intense color palette reminiscent of The Fauves. While living with his brother in Puteaux, a suburb of Paris, Duchamp came in contact with a host of avant-garde writers and poets, notably L\u00e9ger, Apollinaire, and Kupka, and as a result his painting shifted to incorporate the fragmented style of Cubism. This exposure to Cubism, along with his interest in the photographic sequences of Eadweard Muybridge resulted in the work, \"Nude Descending a Staircase No. 2\" (1912). Duchamp tried to show the work at the Salon des Indep\u00e9ndants in Paris, but the title, inscribed on the canvas, was objected to and he withdrew his submission. When it was shown at the Armory Show in New York in 1913, the work gained critical opposition and his name and reputation became forever associated with it. In 1913, Duchamp began to abandon the traditional tools and techniques of painting, attempting to elevate art and the art making process above the purely visual and commercial. During this time, he came in contact with the writing of obscure German philosopher Max Stirner, who believed that the right of an individual was to be held supreme, considered above and beyond the needs of society. It is believed that Duchamp took that notion and applied it to the art object, investigating the possibility of making works of art that were not motivated by aesthetic conditions. It was during this time that he created \"Bicycle Wheel,\" a work created from an inverted bicycle wheel mounted to the seat of a stool. This was one of the first of what he referred to as a \"ready-made,\" a work of art that is deemed so simply through the selection of the artist. In 1915, Duchamp created \"The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even\" (1915-1923) comprised of two large sheets of painted glass in two sections. The \"Bride,\" an anthropomorphic shape, is confined to he top section, and \"the bachelors,\" a composite machine made from a glider and a chocolate grinder at the bottom. The work explores themes of sexual opposition, geometry, physics, and the existing factors of chance. Accompanying the \"Glass\" was a large series of notes, to be consulted as a type of guide. During the teens and 1920s, Duchamp continued to create \"ready-mades,\" giving them ambiguous titles. From 1923-1942, excluding brief trips to the USA, he remained in France where his interest in chess became increasingly more important than creating art. He maintained a low profile in the art world, even though he participated in various Dada and Surrealist exhibitions in Paris and New York. From 1942-1968, Duchamp lived in New York. For 22 years he worked on, and kept secret, his final work, \"Etant donn\u00e9s: 1 La Chute d'Eau, 2 La Gaz d' \u00e9clairage,\" a three-dimensional installation. Duchamp exerted little influence on the work of his contemporaries, but following the installation of his work in the Arensberg Collection in the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1954, he became a cult figure among the avant-garde, both in Europe and the USA. Subsequently, he has been seen as perhaps the most important figure to affect the shift towards conceptual art in the late 20th century.",

      "Introduction": "Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand Duchenne (de Boulogne) (September 17, 1806 in Boulogne-sur-Mer \u2013 September 15, 1875 in Paris) was a French neurologist who revived Galvani's research and greatly advanced the science of electrophysiology. The era of modern neurology developed from Duchenne's understanding of neural pathways and his diagnostic innovations including deep tissue biopsy, nerve conduction tests (NCS), and clinical photography. This extraordinary range of activities (mostly in the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re) was achieved against the background of a troubled personal life and a generally indifferent medical and scientific establishment.\nNeurology did not exist in France before Duchenne and although many medical historians regard Jean-Martin Charcot as the father of the discipline, Charcot owed much to Duchenne, often acknowledging him as \"mon ma\u00eetre en neurologie\" (my master in neurology). \nThe American neurologist Joseph Collins (1866\u20131950) wrote that Duchenne found neurology \"a sprawling infant of unknown parentage which he succored to a lusty youth.\"\nHis greatest contributions were made in the myopathies that came to immortalize his name, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne-Aran spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne-Erb paralysis, Duchenne's disease (Tabes dorsalis), and Duchenne's paralysis (Progressive bulbar palsy). He was the first clinician to practise muscle biopsy, with an invention he called \"l'emporte-pi\u00e8ce\" (Duchenne's trocar). \nIn 1855 he formalized the diagnostic principles of electrophysiology and introduced electrotherapy  in a textbook titled De l'electrisation localis\u00e9e et de son application \u00e0 la physiologie, \u00e0 la pathologie et \u00e0 la th\u00e9rapeutique. \nA companion atlas to this work, the Album de photographies pathologiques, was the first neurology text illustrated by photographs.  Duchenne's monograph, the M\u00e9canisme de la physionomie humaine \u2013 also illustrated prominently by his photographs \u2013 was the first study on the physiology of emotion and was highly influential on Darwin's work on human evolution and emotional expression.",
