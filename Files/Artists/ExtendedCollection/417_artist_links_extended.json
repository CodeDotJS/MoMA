    "details": {
      "Introduction": "Sh\u014dji Ueda (\u690d\u7530 \u6b63\u6cbb, Ueda Sh\u014dji, 1913\u20132000) was a photographer of Tottori, Japan, who combined surrealist compositional elements with realistic depiction. Most of the work for which Ueda is widely known was photographed within a strip of about 350\u00a0km running from Igumi (on the border of Tottori and Hy\u014dgo) to Hagi (Yamaguchi).The photographs Ueda takes are so unique. And in France, the birthplace of photography, his work style referred to as the Ueda-cho.\nUeda described himself as a mere amateur living in the countryside. Ueda did a lot of his work in his hometown of Tottori.\nUeda was born on 27 March 1913 in Sakai (now Sakaiminato), Tottori. His father was a manufacturer and seller of geta; Sh\u014dji was the only child who survived infancy. The boy received a camera from his father in 1930 and quickly became very involved in photography, submitting his photographs to magazines; his photograph Child on the Beach (\u6d5c\u306e\u5b50\u4f9b), Hama no kodomo) appeared in the December issue of Camera.\nIn 1930 Ueda formed the photographic group Ch\u016bgoku Shashinka Sh\u016bdan (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5199\u771f\u5bb6\u96c6\u56e3) with Ry\u014dsuke Ishizu, Kunio Masaoka, and Akira Nomura (\u91ce\u6751\u79cb\u826f); from 1932 till 1937 the group exhibited its works four times at Konishiroku Hall (\u5c0f\u897f\u516d\u30db\u30fc\u30eb, Konishiroku H\u014dru) in Nihonbashi, Tokyo. Ueda studied at the Oriental School of Photography in Tokyo in 1932 and returned to Sakai, opening a studio, Ueda Shashinj\u014d (\u690d\u7530\u5199\u771f\u5834), when only nineteen.\nUeda married in 1935, and his wife helped him to run his photographic studio. His marriage was a happy one; his wife and their three children are recurring models in his works. Ueda was active as an amateur as well as a professional photographer, participating in various groups.\nIn 1941 Ueda gave up photography, not wanting to become a military photographer. (Toward the end of the war, he was forced to photograph the result of a fire.) He resumed shortly after the war, and in 1947 he joined the Tokyo-based group Ginry\u016bsha.\nUeda found the sand dunes of Tottori excellent backdrops for single and group portraits, typically in square format and until relatively late all in black and white. In 1949, inspired by Kineo Kuwabara, then the editor of Camera, Ueda photographed the dunes with Ken Domon and Y\u014dichi Midorikawa. Some of these have Domon as a model, far from his gruff image. The photographs were first published in the September and October 1949 issues of Camera and have been frequently anthologized. Ueda started photographing nudes on the dunes in 1951, and from 1970 he used them as the backdrop for fashion photography.\nThe postwar concentration on realism led by Domon, followed by the rejection of realism led by Sh\u014dmei T\u014dmatsu, sidelined Ueda's cool vision. Ueda participated in \"Japanese Photography\" at the New York Museum of Modern Art in 1960 and had solo exhibitions in Japan, but had to wait till a 1974 retrospective held in the Nikon Salon in Tokyo and Osaka before his return to popularity. \nUeda remained based in Tottori, opening a studio and camera shop in Yonago in 1965, and in 1972 moving to a new three-storey building in Yonago: Ueda Camera on the first floor, the Charanka (\u8336\u862d\u82b1) coffee shop on the second, and Gallery\u00a0U on the third. The building served as a base for local photographic life.\nFrom 1975 until 1994, Ueda was a professor at Kyushu Sangyo University.\nCritical and popular recognition came from the mid seventies. A succession of book-length collections of new and old appeared. Ueda weathered the death in 1983 of his wife, and continued working well into the 1990s. He died of a heart attack on 4 July 2000.\nThe Shoji Ueda Museum of Photography (\u690d\u7530\u6b63\u6cbb\u5199\u771f\u7f8e\u8853\u9928 Ueda Sh\u014dji Shashin Bijutsukan), devoted to his works, opened in Kishimoto (now H\u014dki, near Yonago) Tottori Prefecture in 1995.\nIn 2015, a retrospective was published featuring previously unseen works. The publishers were given access to 5000 unpublished photos and includes a short story by [Toshiyuki Horie].",

      "Introduction": "Jerry Norman Uelsmann (June 11, 1934 \u2013 April 4, 2022) was an American photographer.\nAs an emerging artist in the 1960s, Jerry Uelsmann received international recognition for surreal, enigmatic photographs (photomontages) made with his unique method of composite printing and his dedication to revealing the deepest emotions of the human condition. Over the next six decades, his contributions to contemporary photography were firmly established with important exhibitions, prestigious awards and numerous publications. Among his awards were a Guggenheim Fellowship, National Endowment, Royal Photographic Society Fellowship, and  Lucie Award.Uelsmann described his creative process as a journey of discovery in the darkroom (visual research laboratory). Going against the established practice of previsualization (Ansel Adams, Edward Weston and others), he coined a new term, post-visualization. He decided the contents of the final print after rather than before pressing the shutter button. Uelsmann constructed his dreams like a visual poet with results that often seemed emotionally more real than the factual world. By the1980s he became one of the most collected photographers in America. His  work influenced generations of both analog and digital photographers. Although he admired digital photography, he remained completely dedicated to the alchemy of film photography in the black and white darkroom.",
