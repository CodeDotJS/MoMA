In the 1980s, Graham became an active observer of New York\u2019s punk and experimental music scenes, collaborating with Sonic Youth and befriending Glenn Branca. His book and film essay Rock My Religion of 1983-1984 linked contemporary music groups to the ecstasy of religious communities. His pavilion structures of glass, steel, and mirrors dominated the latter half of his career, from the 1990s.",

He studied painting for the first time in his 30s, becoming deeply interested in modernism. In addition to gaining attention for his own work, he championed the new movement as a collector and curator. He was a mentor to a younger generation of American artists, who developed the style of Abstract Expressionism in the New York area. In the 1940s and 1950s, Graham developed a new figurative style derived from classical masters, which he first showed in paintings and drawings of Russian soldiers. He died in London, England.",
