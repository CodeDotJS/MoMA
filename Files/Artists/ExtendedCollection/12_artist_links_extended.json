      "Introduction": "American minimalist sculptor whose early work was influenced by Constantin Brancusi, but changed dramatically after he worked on the railway for several years. Andre studied at the Phillips Academy and Kenyon College. In the late 1950s, Andre began creating sculptures, using commercially available materials such as timber, styrofoam, cement blocks, and hay. In addition to being an artist, Andre wrote poetry and was a conductor for the Pennsylvania Railroad. After 1965, his sculptures consisted mainly of 'floor pieces,' consisting of individual units of industrial materials placed directly on the floor in patterns that were inherent to the size and shape of the units themselves. In the 1970s, Andre created many large-scale installations and currently continues to emphasize placement, environment, and materials in his art.",

      "Introduction": "Jules Andr\u00e9 (1807\u20131869) was a French painter.\nAndr\u00e9 was born in Paris in 1807, studied under Andr\u00e9 Jolivard and Louis \u00c9tienne Watelet, and became a landscape painter of merit. He travelled in Belgium, the south of France, and the Rhine country; and he was also employed at the porcelain manufactory at S\u00e8vres.\nAndr\u00e9 painted in a manner halfway between the style of the old French classic landscape painters and that of the modern school. He executed several decorative panels in the new Louvre Palace, and in the H\u00f4tel d'Albe. He obtained a second-class medal in 1835, and the decoration of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1853.\nHe died at Paris in 1869.  The Galleries of the Luxembourg and Lille possess paintings by him.\nHis son, Edmond Maethe Alphonse Andr\u00e9 (1844\u20131877), who studied under him, and with Isidore Pils, became a genre painter of some repute. In 1876 he painted a 'Halt of Zouaves at Patay.' Edmond died in Algiers in 1877.",

Anguiano was born during the height of the Mexican Revolution, which would inspire a majority of his mural painting. He studied painting in his hometown of Guadalajara before moving to Mexico City to begin his career. His first major exhibition was held at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, at age 20. His works include over 100 individual and collective exhibitions with 50 murals, mostly in Mexico and the United States. As he continued his artistry with aspects of the Mexican muralism movement, he also experimented with other styles such as Cubism, Surrealism and Expressionism, with themes such as clowns and prostitutes. However, his most famous painting is \u201cLa espina\u201d (The thorn) which depicts a Mayan woman digging a thorn out of her foot with a knife. His later works concentrated on depicting Mexico in vivid colors and traditional imagery.",

A member of Mir Iskusstva.\nIn his essay \"On Synthetism\" (1922), Yevgeny Zamyatin writes that \"[Annenkov] has a keen awareness of the extraordinary rush and dynamism of our epoch. His sense of time is developed to the hundredth of a second. He has the knack--characteristic of Synthetism--of giving only the synthetic essence of things.\"\nYury Annenkov was born into a well-known family (among his ancestors was Pavel Annenkov, Alexander Pushkin's publisher); his father, Pavel Annenkov was involved with revolutionary activities that led him to exile in Siberia. The Annenkovs moved back to St.\u00a0Petersburg in 1892.\nIn 1908, Annenkov entered the University of St. Petersburg and attended Savely Seidenberg's studio classes, together with Marc Chagall. Next year, 1909, he attended Jan Ci\u0105gli\u0144ski's studio. In 1911\u20131912, Annenkov moved to Paris to work in the studios of Maurice Denis and F\u00e9lix Vallotton. In 1913, Annenkov worked in Switzerland. Upon his return to St.\u00a0Petersburg in 1914, Annenkov mostly contributed to magazines (Satirikon, Teatr i Iskusstvo, Otechestvo) and worked for theatres.\nMaxim Gorky's fairy-tale book, Samovar, published in 1917 was his first work as a book designer. His recognition as a book illustrator came in the wake of his most known work\u00a0\u2014 designing Alexander Blok's poem, \"The Twelve\", published in 1918 and gone through three printings within a year. In the next few years Annenkov designed numerous books for Petrograd authors (Mikhail Kuzmin and Aleksey Remizov, to name a few). In 1919 Annenkov designed and staged \"First Distiller, or How an Imp Earned a Hunk of Bread\", a comedy by Count Lev Tolstoi.\nCommissioned by the Bolshevik government, Annenkov together with Mstislav Dobuzhinsky, S. Maslovski and A. Kugel, designed and staged the open-air mystery \"Liberated Labour Anthem\" on 1 May 1920 in Petrograd. Later that year, Annenkov staged and designed another mass show, The Storming of the Winter Palace, part of the October Revolution anniversary celebrations in Palace Square, Petrograd. In 1919-1920 Annenkov made a series of abstract sculptural assemblages and collages, influenced by the Dada movement.\n1922 saw his book \"Portraits\". It contained 80 pictures of the key-figures of Russian art of the time (Gorki, Zamyatin, Remizov, Sologub, Blok, Akhmatova a.o.) made in 1906\u20131921. The book also included essays by Yevgeny Zamyatin and Mikhail Kuzmin. He joined the Mir Iskusstva.\nAnnenkov left the Soviet in July 1924, first living in Germany and later settling in Paris.\nHe continued to work as an artist and served as a costume designer for motion pictures. He was co-nominated with Rosine Delamare for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design for their work in the film The Earrings of Madame de... (1953).\nIn 1934 he wrote a satyrical novel A Tale of Trivia (\u041f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043a\u0430\u0445) under a pen name B. Temiriasev. The novel takes place between the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War.",
