      "Introduction": "Nan Hoover (12 May 1931 \u2013 9 June 2008) was a Dutch/American-expatriate artist who is known for her pioneering work in video art, photography and performance art. She spent almost four decades living and working in the Netherlands. She also used the mediums of drawing, painting, photography and film and created art objects and sculptures. One of the main themes of her art was light and motion. The rigorous, minimalist handling of her means as well as the intense concentration with which she performed within spaces of light and shadow are the most salient characteristics of her artistic work.\nWith her exploration of new media her artistic practice gained international recognition. Her performances and light installations were shown worldwide in museums, exhibition houses and in public spaces. In 1977 she participated in the documenta 6 and in 1987 the documenta 8 in Kassel. In 1984 Hoover participated in the Biennale di Venezia. She taught art at the San Francisco Art Institute in 1986, was professor for video and film at the D\u00fcsseldorf Art Academy from 1987\u00a0-\u00a01997, taught mixed media at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy Amsterdam from 1998\u00a0\u2013\u00a01999, and held classes in video and performance at the International Summer Academy in Salzburg from 1994\u00a0-\u00a01996 and in 2001.",
