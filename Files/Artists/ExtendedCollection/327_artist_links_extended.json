      "Introduction": "Marjetica Potr\u010d ([ma\u02c8\u027eje\u02d0titsa p\u0254\u02c8t\u0259\u027et\u0283]; born 1953) is an artist and architect based in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Potr\u010d's interdisciplinary practice includes on-site projects, research, architectural case studies, and drawings (visual essays and diagrams). Her work documents and interprets contemporary architectural practices (in particular, with regard to energy infrastructure and water use) and the ways people live together. She is especially interested in social architecture and how communities and governments can work together to make stronger, more resilient cities. In later projects, she has also focused on the relationship between human society and nature, and advocated for the rights of nature. \nHer work almost always involves collaborations, both with other artists, architects, and specialists from various disciplines as well as with local communities. \"Her projects display a unique sensibility for identifying the existing social capital in a community, which she utilizes as she works to find solutions to everyday problems.\" (statement from the Curry Stone Foundation). Through these collaborations, including, especially, with the students in her Design for the Living World class, her work explores new methodologies, tools, and strategies that local residents can use to make their communities and living environments better able to respond to future challenges. She describes such collaborative work as a \"partnership in knowledge exchange\" and stresses the importance of developing new alliances, such as between environmentalists and Indigenous peoples, to create a new \"hybrid\" knowledge that goes beyond the standardized, objective knowledge of the modernist discourse.",
