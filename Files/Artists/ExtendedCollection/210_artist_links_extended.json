He emigrated to Canada in 1924 escaping Armenian genocide in Turkey, where he came under the care of his uncle, George Nakash, an established photographer. He opened his own portrait studio in 1932 in Ottowa, where he quickly gained a reputation as a talented photographer whose clients came to include high-ranking individuals. He achieved international success in 1941 with his famous portrait of Winston Churchill. This image poses the qualities that would become the Karsh trademark: strong chiaroscuro modeling the sitter's face. From 1969, he taught at numerous universities and academies.",
