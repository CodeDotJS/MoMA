In 1887, the firm changed its name to Henry Dixon & Son. Henry Dixon, in collaboration with Alfred and John Bool, made carbon prints from negatives taken by the Bools. They were employed by the Society for Photographing Relics of Old London to photograph threatened buildings. The society was formed in 1875 and consisted of architects and antiquarians who wished to preserve a record of historic buildings facing demolition. In 1875, Dixon along with Alfred and John Bool, photographed the Oxford Arms Inn near St. Paul's Cathedral, London. In 1879, Dixon and his son T. J. Dixon began to photograph as well as print the series of architectural views that were distributed annually to the members of the Society for Photographing Relics of Old London.",

He is also known for his nudes and for his portraits of Germany's literary and theatrical bohemia and its patrons. Dix was a founder-member of the Dresdner Sezession Gruppe 1919, a group of radical Expressionist and Dada artists and writers. His later work includes landscapes and paintings of biblical themes. Dix was unusual in his ability to negotiate between the regimes of West and East Germany, making yearly trips to Dresden, appointed to the academies of both West and East Berlin, and the recipient of major awards in both the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic.",

      "Introduction": "Frank Owen Dobson  (18 November 1886 \u2013 22 July 1963) was a British artist and sculptor. Dobson began as a painter, and his early work was influenced by cubism, vorticism, and futurism. After World War I, however, he turned increasingly toward sculpture in a more or less realist style. Throughout the 1920s and the early 1930s he built a reputation as an outstanding sculptor and was among the first in Britain to prefer direct carving of the material rather than modelling a maquette first. The simplified forms and flowing lines of much of his sculptures, particularly his female nudes, showed the influence of African art. From 1946 to 1953 Dobson was Professor of Sculpture at the Royal College of Art. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1953. While Dobson was one of the most esteemed artists of his time, after his death his reputation declined with the move towards postmodernism and conceptual art. However, in recent years a revival has begun. Dobson is now seen as one of the most important British sculptors of the 20th century.",

Van Doesburg is best known as the founder and editor of the journal 'De Stijl', which brought together painters and architects in support of Modern art. Among his supporters and collaborators were the artist Piet Mondrian, and the architects J. J. P. Oud and Jan Wils. Van Doesburg's own paintings were Comment on works: abstractions based on nature, dissolving the difference between foreground and background. In the early 1920s, Van Doesburg travelled to Germany, where he lectured at the Bauhaus and was involved in the Dada movement. In 1923 he moved to Paris and experimented with different concepts in architecture. Unlike the other sources, Macmillan indicates that van Doesburg was not an architect, although his works \"... have some significance for the history of modern architecture... he was a painter, designer, typographer, critic, writer, and teacher...\".
