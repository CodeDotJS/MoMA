      "Introduction": "Born in Copenhagen in 1938, Kirkeby received a Master\u2019s degree in arctic geology at the University of Copenhagen in 1964. He later studied at the Eks-Skolen (Experimental Art School of Copenhagen), established by the artist Poul Gernes in 1961 as an alternative to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, and became involved with the Fluxus movement. Kirkbey made Pop-inspired works on masonite in the 1960s, and began producing blackboards and small-scale sculptures in the 1970s, but would not draw great attention until the 1980s, when he associated with German Artists Georg Baselitz, Markus L\u00fcpertz, A.R. Penck, J\u00f6rg Immendorff, and Anselm Kiefer. Kirkeby represented Denmark at the 1976 Venice Biennale and later participated in Documenta VII and IX.",

      "Introduction": "Jacob Kirkegaard is a sound artist born in 1975 in Denmark. In early 2006 he graduated at the Academy of Arts and the Media in Cologne, Germany. Jacob is exploring sound in art with a scientific approach. \nJacob Kirkegaard's sound works focus on investigations into the potential musicality in hidden sound layers in the environment. In this context he has been capturing and exploring sounds from, for example, volcanic earth, ice, atmospheric phenomena, nuclear power plants and deserted places. His piece \"Labyrinthitis\" was created from sounds recorded inside his inner ear. Recording tools used include accelometers, hydrophones and home-built electromagnetic receivers.",

      "Introduction": "Konrad Klapheck (born February 10, 1935) is a German painter and graphic artist whose style of painting combines features of Surrealism and Pop art. \nHe was born in D\u00fcsseldorf. From 1954 to 1956 he studied painting under Bruno Goller at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf. Klapheck's works of the mid-1950s are in a magic realist style that became more idiosyncratic when he painted the first of his typewriters. His subsequent paintings, often large in scale, are precise and seemingly realistic depictions of technical equipment, machinery and everyday objects, but strangely alienated; they are \"monumental, amusingly absurd and sexually suggestive\".Klapheck's subjects through the years have included (in order of introduction) typewriters, sewing machines, water taps and showers, telephones, irons, shoes, keys, saws, car tires, bicycle bells and clocks. Influenced by Duchamp, Man Ray, and Max Ernst, Klapheck's \"ironic treatment of everyday mechanics\" prefigures Pop art in its magnification of the trivial. He was also close to French Surrealism and Andr\u00e9 Breton wrote his last published text about a Klapheck's exhibition at Galerie Sonnabend in 1965.\nBetween 1992 and 2002, he has painted friends, colleagues, and celebrities from the international art scene. He became a professor at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf in 1979.",
