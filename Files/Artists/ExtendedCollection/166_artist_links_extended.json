As a youth he spent time in Kansas City, MO, and Edmonton, Alberta, and briefly attended school in England before studying painting at the Sorbonne in Paris (1933\u20135). In 1934 his drawings were to have been exhibited at the Galerie aux Quatre Chemins in Paris alongside works by Dadaists and Surrealists, but they were removed by Paul Eluard on Andr\u00e9 Breton\u2019s orders. He later lived in New York City, Tangier, and Paris, where he spent the rest of his life. He collaborated with William S. Burroughs on books, and together they invented the 'cut-up' technique. His paintings involved a brushed calligraphic stroke, and he notably invented the 'Dreamachine' a device intended to create stroboscopic optical effects.",

In addition to his coverage of events around the globe after World War II, Haas was an early innovator in color photography. His images were disseminated by magazines like Life and Vogue and, in 1962, were the subject of the first single-artist exhibition of color photography at New York's Museum of Modern Art. He served as president of the cooperative Magnum Photos, and his book The Creation (1971) was one of the most successful photography books ever, selling 350,000 copies.",
