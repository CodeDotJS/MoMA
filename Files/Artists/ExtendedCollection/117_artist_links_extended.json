In 2014, Olafur and his long-time collaborator \u2013 German architect Sebastian Behmann \u2013 founded Studio Other Spaces, an office for architecture and art. \nOlafur represented Denmark at the 50th Venice Biennale in 2003 and later that year installed The Weather Project, which has been described as \"a milestone in contemporary art\", in the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern, London.\nOlafur has engaged in a number of public projects, including the intervention Green river, carried out in various cities between 1998 and 2001; the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion 2007, London, a temporary pavilion designed with the Norwegian architect Kjetil Tr\u00e6dal Thorsen; and The New York City Waterfalls, commissioned by Public Art Fund in 2008. Olafur also created the Breakthrough Prize trophy. Like much of his work, the sculpture explores the common ground between art and science. It is molded into the shape of a toroid, recalling natural forms found from black holes and galaxies to seashells and coils of DNA.Olafur was a professor at the Berlin University of the Arts from 2009 to 2014 and has been an adjunct professor at the Alle School of Fine Arts and Design in Addis Ababa since 2014. His studio is based in Berlin, Germany.",
