From 1917-1919, Lange started out as an independent portrait photographer in San Francisco, but soon began photographing the homeless in order to bring attention to their plight. In 1935, she joined the Farm Security Administration and reported on living conditions in rural areas. Her images show not only despair and loss, but also a sense of pride with which these people endured their circumstances. \"Migrant Mother,\" a portrait of a world-weary mother and her three children is one of Lange's most well known images from this period.",

One of the best-known \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Germany's school of Expressionism, he was dubbed the \"Master of Darkness\" by the British Film Institute. He has been cited as one of the most influential filmmakers of all time.Lang's most celebrated films include the groundbreaking futuristic science-fiction film Metropolis (1927) and the influential M (1931), a film noir precursor. His 1929 film Woman in the Moon showcased the use of a multi-stage rocket, and also pioneered the concept of a rocket launch pad (a rocket standing upright against a tall building before launch having been slowly rolled into place) and the rocket-launch countdown clock. His other major films include Dr. Mabuse the Gambler (1922), Die Nibelungen (1924), and after moving to Hollywood in 1934, Fury (1936), You Only Live Once  (1937), Hangmen Also Die! (1943), The Woman in the Window (1944), Scarlet Street (1945) and The Big Heat (1953). He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1939.",
