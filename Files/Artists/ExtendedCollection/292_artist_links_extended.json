      "Introduction": "Kazuo Nakamura  was a Japanese-Canadian painter and sculptor (born Vancouver October 13, 1926; died Toronto April 9, 2002) and a founding member of the Toronto-based Painters Eleven group in the 1950s. Among the first major Japanese Canadian artists to emerge in the twentieth century, Nakamura created innovative landscape paintings and abstract compositions inspired by nature, mathematics, and science. His painting is orderly and restrained in contrast to other members of Painters Eleven. His idealism about science echoed the beliefs of Lawren Harris and Jock Macdonald.",

Namuth specialized in portraiture, photographing many artists, including abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock.  His photos of Pollock at work in his studio increased Pollock's fame and recognition and led to a greater understanding of his work and techniques.  Namuth used his outgoing personality and persistence to photograph many important artistic figures at work in their studios.\nNamuth photographed many other painters such as Willem de Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg, and Mark Rothko and architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Louis Kahn.  Namuth focused on his rapport with his subjects, getting many reclusive figures such as Clyfford Still to agree to be photographed.  Namuth's work not only captured his subjects in their studios with their works, but also captured the relationship between photographer and subject as well as the subjects' levels of self-consciousness.  Besides famous art figures, Namuth photographed the Mam people of Todos Santos, whose native lifestyles were being overrun by Western influences.  Namuth died in a Long Island car crash in 1990.",

He played guitar in the Contortions and percussion in the Del-Byzanteens, two downtown 'No Wave' groups active at this time, and founded CoLab (Collaborative Projects, Inc.). His paintings are abstract, usually large-scale, consisting of lone gestural strokes achieved with brushes the artist fabricates himself. He has also used mechanical means for creating works, including a rotating drum on which he attaches supports for drawings. In 2019 Nares revealed that he is transitioning to a female identity.",
