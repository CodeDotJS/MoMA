Whilst in exile in Mexico, he founded his own counter-surrealist art-magazine DYN, in which he summarized his critical attitude towards radical subjectivism and Freudo-Marxism in Surrealism with his philosophy of contingency. He rejoined the group between 1951 and 1954, during his sojourn in Paris.",

      "Introduction": "Walter Pach (July 1, 1883 \u2013 November 27, 1958) was an artist, critic, lecturer, art adviser, and art historian who wrote extensively about modern art and championed its cause. Through his numerous books, articles, and translations of European art texts Pach brought the emerging modernist viewpoint to the American public.He organized exhibitions of contemporary art for New York City galleries of the period. He was also extremely helpful to Arthur B. Davies, president of the landmark exhibition of 1913, the \"International Exhibition of Modern Art,\" known as the Armory Show, as well as to one of its founders Walt Kuhn, by bringing together leading contemporary European and American artists. Another original founder Jerome Myers spent over a year supervising the American portion of the show.\nPach helped John Quinn and Walter Arensberg gather their collections. He also secured individual works for museums, such as a portrait by Thomas Eakins for the Louvre, and Jacques-Louis David's The Death of Socrates for the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nPach's fluency in French, German, and Spanish made it possible for him to understand and interpret the avant-garde ideas developing in Europe and translate them for the English-speaking audience. He was able to communicate personally with many noted artists in Europe and Mexico and mediate between gallery dealers and museum curators on their behalf. His correspondence with major figures in 20th-century art are an important source of information, not only about the artists but about the art world during the first half of the 20th century.",

      "Introduction": "Homer Page (1918\u20131985) was an American documentary photographer whose most famous photographs were taken in New York City in 1949\u20131950, after he received a grant from the Guggenheim Foundation.\nPage was born in Oakland, California, and studied art and social psychology at the University of California, graduating in 1940.  He worked in the shipyards in the Oakland-San Francisco Bay Area during World War II.  His neighbor and later his mentor, photographer Dorothea Lange, encouraged him to take up photography in 1944. By 1947, he was featured in a major show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\nPage received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1949 and spent a year documenting modern urban culture, primarily by photographing people on the streets of New York City. Most of his subjects appear unaware of his presence.\nSome of Page's photographs were included in Edward Steichen's landmark Family of Man exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1955.  His photographs appeared in publications including Harper's Magazine, and books such as The Little World of Laos. In 1966, he published a collection of his photographs, titled Puerto Rico: The Quiet Revolution.\nPage produced several photo stories for the World Health Organization from 1957 to 1960. Most of his photographs focused on health in the United States, but he also traveled to Latin America, Asia and Africa to photograph topics including rural health, yaws and trachoma.\nThe bulk of Page's career was spent as a magazine photographer, and, as a result, few of his photographs were in private hands and his work was largely forgotten by the time of his death in 1985, at the age of 67.\nKeith F. Davis, Curator of Photography at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, while researching and writing the first edition of An American Century of Photography, published in 1995, became aware of Page's non-magazine work.  Davis searched for Page's photographs, leading to the discovery of a \"lost\" photographic treasure.  After negotiations with the Page estate, Nelson-Atkins purchased about 100 prints for the Museum's Hallmark Photographic Collection, including many that were one of a kind.",

In addition to posters, he designs theatrical settings, prints and catalogues.\nOne of the younger of the Third Generation of artists of Polish School of Posters, he easily made the transition from socialism to capitalism; in 1990, he created his own graphic studio, STUDIO P, which developed into an advertising agency in 1993 and continues in operation today. In 1992, he had become art director of the Polish edition of Playboy. As an artist, his individualized posters evoke a range of moods and ideas. He claims to have created a separate concept for each of his many posters, saying: \u201cEvery poster for me is an individual exercise different from the previous one.\u201d His art can be found in many European museums as well as the Museum of Modern Art in New York,.

He began his career as a musician and wrote his thesis at Tokyo University on Arnold Shoenberg. He continued his studies in Munich and Freiburg, and gravitated to the avant-garde music scene in Cologne and Darmstadt, where he worked with Karlheinz Stockhausen. He met John Cage and began incorporating elements of what would become performance art into musical events, which led to an involvement with the Fluxus group. He exhibited the first known art work to incorporate television sets in 1963, and is perhaps most widely known for his collaborations with Charlotte Moorman, beginning in 1965, which resulted in the creation of his \"TV Bra for Living Sculpture.\" He is credited with coining the phrase \"electronic superhighway.\" Major retrospectives of his work were held at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1982, and the Guggenheim Museum in 2000.",
