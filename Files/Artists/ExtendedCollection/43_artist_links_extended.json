      "Introduction": "Hyman Bloom (March 29, 1913 \u2013 August 26, 2009) was a Latvian-born American painter. His work was influenced by his Jewish heritage and Eastern religions as well as by artists including Altdorfer, Gr\u00fcnewald, Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Blake, Bresdin, Ensor and Soutine. He first came to prominence when his work was included in the 1942 Museum of Modern Art exhibition \"Americans 1942 -- 18 Artists from 9 States\".   MoMA purchased 2 paintings from the exhibition and Time magazine singled him out as a \"striking discovery\" in their exhibition review.\nHis work was selected for both the 1948 and 1950 Venice Biennale exhibitions and his 1954 retrospective traveled from Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art to the Albright Gallery and the de Young Museum before closing out at The Whitney Museum of American Art in 1955.   In a 1954 interview with Yale art professor Bernard Chaet, Willem de Kooning indicated that he and Jackson Pollock both considered Bloom to be \u201cAmerica\u2019s first abstract expressionist\u201d, a label that Bloom would disavow.  Starting in the mid 1950s his work began to shift more towards works on paper and he exclusively focused on drawing throughout the 1960s, returning to painting in 1971.  He continued both drawing and painting until his death in 2009 at the age of 96.",
