Many of Trova's sculptures are cast in unusual white bronze. He began as a painter, progressing through three-dimensional constructions to his mature medium, sculpture. Trova's gift of forty of his works led to the opening of St. Louis County, Missouri's Laumeier Sculpture Park.",

In 1978, he was included in the New Image Painting exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art.  He currently lives and paints in New York, and teaches at Cooper Union.\nFor most of his career, David True painted the human image, but in the 1980s, turned to nature for some of his subjects.  Zen of Alarm, from 1988, is a promised gift to the Honolulu Museum of Art.  This acrylic and ink painting conveys the surrealist nature of much of the artist's work. Throughout the 1980s, David True created a series of woodblock and other fine art prints published by Crown Point Press.\nThe Denver Art Museum, Henie-Onstad Art Centre (Hoevikodden, Norway), Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art (Cornell University), Honolulu Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Minneapolis Institute of Art, Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute (Utica, N.Y.), Museum of Modern Art, Rhode Island School of Design Museum, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), Whitney Museum of American Art, Yale University Art Gallery are among the public collections holding works by David True.",
