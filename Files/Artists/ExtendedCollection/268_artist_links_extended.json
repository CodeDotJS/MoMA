      "Introduction": "American cartoonist best known for his fanciful, imaginative cartoons, most notably, \"Little Nemo in Slumberland.\" In 1905 he took \"Nemo\" on the vaudeville circuit as a chalk-talk artist, an artist who draws cartoons on a black board in front of a live audience. With his interest in film, MacCay began to create some of the earliest animated cartoons, such as \"Gertie The Dinosaur\" (1914). Similar to his chalk-talk career, MacCay traveled the country with his film, interacting with the character on the screen.",
