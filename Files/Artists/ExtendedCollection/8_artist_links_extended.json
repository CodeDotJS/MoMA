      "Introduction": "Allgemeine Elektricit\u00e4ts-Gesellschaft AG (German for 'General electricity company JSC' AEG) was a German producer of electrical equipment founded in Berlin as the Deutsche Edison-Gesellschaft f\u00fcr angewandte Elektricit\u00e4t in 1883 by Emil Rathenau. \nThe company's initial focus was driven by electrical lighting, as in 1881, Rathenau had acquired the rights to the electric light bulb at the International Exposition of Electricity in Paris. Using small power stations, his company introduced electrical lighting to caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and theaters, despite the high costs and limitations. By the end of the 19th century, AEG had constructed 248 power stations, providing a total of 210,000 hp of electricity for lighting, tramways, and household devices.During the Second World War, AEG worked with the Nazi Party and benefited from forced labour from concentration camps. After World War II, its headquarters moved to Frankfurt am Main.\nIn 1967, AEG joined with its subsidiary Telefunken AG, creating Allgemeine Elektricit\u00e4ts-Gesellschaft AEG-Telefunken. In 1985, Daimler-Benz purchased the AEG-Telefunken Aktiengesellschaft (which was renamed to AEG Aktiengesellschaft) and wholly integrated the company in 1996 into Daimler-Benz AG (1998: DaimlerChrysler). The remains of AEG became part of Adtranz (later Bombardier Transportation) and Deutsche Aerospace (1998: DASA, today part of Airbus SE).\nAfter acquiring the AEG household subsidiary AEG Hausger\u00e4te GmbH in 1994, Electrolux obtained the rights to the AEG brand name in 2005, which it now uses on some of its products. The AEG name is also licensed to various brand partners under the Electrolux Global Brand Licensing program.",
