      "Introduction": "William Ralph Wright (born January 20, 1960) is an American video game designer and co-founder of the game development company Maxis, which later became part of Electronic Arts. In April 2009, he left EA to run Stupid Fun Club Camp, an entertainment think tank in which Wright and EA are principal shareholders.The first computer game Wright designed was Raid on Bungeling Bay in 1984, but it was SimCity that brought him to prominence. The game was published by Maxis, which Wright co-formed with Jeff Braun. Wright continued to innovate on the game's central theme of simulation with numerous other titles including SimEarth and SimAnt.\nWright has earned many awards for his work in game design. He is best known for being the original designer of The Sims series, of which Maxis developed the first entry in 2000. The game spawned multiple sequels, including The Sims 2, The Sims 3, The Sims 4 and their expansion packs. His latest work, Spore, released in September 2008 and features gameplay based upon the model of evolution and scientific advancement. The game sold 406,000 copies within three weeks of its release.In 2007, he became the first game designer to receive the BAFTA Fellowship, which had previously only been presented to those in the film and television industries.",

      "Introduction": "Wanda Wulz (Trieste, Austro-Hungarian Empire 25 July 1903 \u2013 Trieste, Italy, 16 April 1984) was an Italian experimental photographer. \nWulz was born on 25 July 1903 in Trieste, Italy. Both her grandfather Giuseppe Wulz and her father Carlo Wulz were photographers who shot social events and created portraits of fellow artists and local intellectuals. Wanda began her career photographing musicians, dancers, and actors in Trieste. She exhibited six photographs in Rome in 1930. One example of her work is her self-portrait merged with a portrait of a cat.Wanda often collaborated on work with her sister, Marion Wulz. Both Wanda and Marion would take over the photography studio of their father Carlo. Before creating her own work, Marion, who was also a painter under Pietro Lucano, served as a model for her father's photography. The sisters photographed celebrities such as dancers Nini Perno and Alba Wiegele, fencer Irene Camber, and were photographed together by fashion designer Anita Pittoni.In 1932, she joined the Futurist movement after meeting Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in an art exhibition. Her photography in the late 1930s would frequently incorporate superposed images and motion. She eventually left Futurism at the end of the 1930s.",
