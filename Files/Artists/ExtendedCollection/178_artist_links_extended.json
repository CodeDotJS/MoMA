      "Introduction": "Heinz Henghes (20 August 1906 \u2013 20 December 1975) was a British sculptor.\nBorn Gustav Heinrich Clusmann in Hamburg (Germany). At the age of 17, Henghes ran away from home to go to the United States. In New York City he met a number of artists and writers and was influenced by Isamu Noguchi. In 1932, after eight years in America, Henghes travelled to France and lived for a short time in Paris where he met Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i. In 1933 he went on to Rapallo in Italy where he enjoyed the patronage of Ezra Pound, who helped him by providing materials and space to work. For the next four years, Henghes was based in Italy, holding a number of exhibitions and building his reputation as a sculptor.\nIn 1937, following a further interlude in Paris, Henghes moved to England and set up his studio in London. By the time of the outbreak of war he had exhibited in various venues including the Guggenheim Jeune Gallery in Cork Street. Still a German national, Henghes was sent on the notorious ship the HMT Dunera to Australia where he was briefly interned in 1940 at Camp Hay. In 1941 he returned to England and for much of the war did freelance writing on current affairs for the BBC. His talks were broadcast on Radio Newsreel, on the Latin American Service, on the Italian Programme and other services in a variety of languages.\nOne man and group shows increased after the war and, whilst a lecturer in sculpture at the Royal College of Art in London, Henghes participated in the 1951 Festival of Britain. During this period he also broadcast on art and became a naturalised British citizen.\nIn 1953 Henghes moved to the Dordogne region of France where he was drawn by the discovery of Lascaux. In 1964 he returned to England to take up the post of Head of Fine Art at Winchester School of Art. He retired again to France in 1973. He died in Bordeaux in 1975.\nHenghes is particularly noted for his finely polished white marble torsos, but he moved with the times, always living for the present, and worked in a range of materials and styles.",

      "Introduction": "James Maury Henson (September 24, 1936\u00a0\u2013 May 16, 1990) was an American puppeteer, animator, cartoonist, actor, inventor, and filmmaker who achieved worldwide notability as the creator of the Muppets. Henson was also well-known for creating Fraggle Rock (1983\u20131987) and as the director of The Dark Crystal (1982) and Labyrinth (1986). He was born in Greenville, Mississippi, and raised in both Leland, Mississippi, and University Park, Maryland.\nHenson began developing puppets in high school. He created Sam and Friends (1955\u20131961), a short-form comedy television program, while he was a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park in collaboration with Jane Nebel, who was a senior there. A few years later the two married. He graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in home economics, after which he and Jane produced coffee advertisements and developed experimental films. In 1958, he co-founded Muppets, Inc. with Jane; it later became The Jim Henson Company.\nIn 1969, Henson joined the children's educational television program Sesame Street (1969\u2013present) where he helped to develop Muppet characters for the series. He and his creative team also appeared on the first season of the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (1975\u2013present). He produced the sketch comedy television series The Muppet Show (1976\u20131981) during this period. He won fame for his characters, particularly Kermit the Frog, Rowlf the Dog and Ernie. During the later years of his life, he founded the Jim Henson Foundation and Jim Henson's Creature Shop. He won the Emmy Award twice for his involvement in The StoryTeller (1987\u20131988) and The Jim Henson Hour (1989).\nOn May 16, 1990, Henson died in New York City at age 53 from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. At the time of his death, he was in negotiations to sell his company to The Walt Disney Company, but talks fell through after his passing. He posthumously received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991, and was named a Disney Legend in 2011.",
