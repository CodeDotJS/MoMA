      "Introduction": "Jir\u014d Takamatsu (\u9ad8\u677e \u6b21\u90ce, Takamatsu Jir\u014d, 20 February 1936 \u2013 25 June 1998) was one of the most important postwar Japanese artists. Takamatsu used photography, sculpture, painting, drawing, and performance to fundamentally investigate the philosophical and material conditions of art. Takamatsu's practice was dedicated to the critique of cognition and perception, through the rendering and variation of morphological devices, such as shadow, tautology, appropriation, perceptual and perspective distortion and representation. Takamatsu's conceptual work can be understood through his notions of the Zero Dimension, which renders an object or form to observe its fundamental geometrical components. Takamatsu isolated these smallest constituent elements, asserting that these elements produce reality, or existence. For Takamatsu the elementary particle represents \u201cthe ultimate of division\u201d and also \u201cemptiness itself,\u201d like the a line within a painting\u2014there appears to be nothing more beyond the line itself. Yet, Takamatsu's end goal was not to just prove the presence or object-ness of these elements, but rather used them as a way to challenge and prove the limits of human perception, leading to his fixation on \u201cabsence\u201d or the things that are unobservable.The impact of Takamatsu's practice also has to be considered in terms of his contributions to the avant garde art scenes through his individual practice and work with collectives, as well as the legibility of his work in the discourse of conceptual art and thus the broader international art world.",

      "Introduction": "Talking Heads was an American rock band that formed in 1975 in New York City. The band was composed of David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar),  Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass) and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described as \"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s\", Talking Heads helped to pioneer new wave music by combining elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with an anxious, clean-cut image.Byrne, Frantz and Weymouth met as freshman students at the Rhode Island School of Design.:\u200a24\u200a They moved to New York City in 1975, joined the New York punk scene, recruited Harrison, and changed their name to Talking Heads. Their debut album, Talking Heads: 77, was released in 1977 to positive reviews. They collaborated with the British producer Brian Eno on the acclaimed albums More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978), Fear of Music (1979), and Remain in Light (1980), which blended their art school sensibilities with influence from artists such as Parliament-Funkadelic and Fela Kuti. From the early 1980s, they included additional musicians in their recording sessions and shows, including guitarist Adrian Belew, keyboardist Bernie Worrell, singer Nona Hendryx, and bassist Busta Jones.\nAfter a hiatus, Talking Heads reached their commercial peak in 1983 with the U.S. Top 10 hit \"Burning Down the House\" from the album Speaking in Tongues. In 1984, they released the concert film Stop Making Sense, directed by Jonathan Demme. For these performances, they were joined by Worrell, the guitarist Alex Weir, the percussionist Steve Scales and the singers Lynn Mabry and Ednah Holt. In 1985, Talking Heads released their best-selling album, Little Creatures. They produced a soundtrack album for Byrne's film True Stories (1986), and released their final album, worldbeat-influenced Naked (1988), before disbanding in 1991. Without Byrne, the other band members performed under the name Shrunken Heads, and released an album, No Talking, Just Head, as the Heads in 1996.\nIn 2002, Talking Heads were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of their albums appeared in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, and three of their songs (\"Psycho Killer\", \"Life During Wartime\", and \"Once in a Lifetime\") were included among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. Talking Heads were also number 64 on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". In the 2011 update of Rolling Stone's \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", they were ranked number 100.",
