As a young adult Ichimura moved to Tokyo, where he studied for a year at Nihon University, took various jobs, and chanced to meet Sh\u014dtar\u014d Akiyama, who aroused his interest in photography.  Ichimura won a special award at the First International Subjectivism Photo Exhibition (\u56fd\u969b\u4e3b\u89b3\u4e3b\u7fa9\u5199\u771f\u5c55, Kokusai Shukanshugi Shashinten), held at Takashimaya in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, in 1956. He quickly moved to nude photography, and had his first solo exhibition, \"Love & Lost\", in Fuji Photo Salon in 1963. He also participated in exhibitions overseas: \"New Japanese Photography\" in New York (7 Works  owned by MoMA) in 1974 and an exhibition of eight Japanese photographers in Graz in 1976. From the late 1970s Ichimura branched out to photographs of Japanese iconography and landscape, particularly that of his native Nagasaki.",
