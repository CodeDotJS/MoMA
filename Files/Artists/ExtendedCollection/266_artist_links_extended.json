      "Introduction": "D\u00f3ra Maurer (born 1937 in Budapest) is a Hungarian visual artist whose work has spanned a 50-year career. She works in almost every medium, from film and photography, to painting, performance, and sculpture.  Principally achieving recognition in the 1970s with avant-garde work, Maurer has developed her art career from works with contemporary and modern influences that have been shown worldwide. Her art is based on mathematical  and complex system processes. Most of Maurer's work follows the theme of showing options to the viewer and what the viewer can do with those options. Many of her works break down simple actions so the viewer can really view the piece as movement, not a photograph of movement. D\u00f3ra Maurer has in addition been a professor at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Budapest and a curator.",

He co-signed the Futurist manifesto, A Slap in the Face of Public Taste (1913), and wrote such poems as \"A Cloud in Trousers\" (1915) and \"Backbone Flute\" (1916). Mayakovsky produced a large and diverse body of work during the course of his career: he wrote poems, wrote and directed plays, appeared in films, edited the art journal LEF, and produced agitprop posters in support of the Communist Party during the Russian Civil War of 1917\u20131922. Though Mayakovsky's work regularly demonstrated ideological and patriotic support for the ideology of the Bolsheviks and a strong admiration of Vladimir Lenin, his relationship with the Soviet state was always complex and often tumultuous. Mayakovsky often found himself engaged in confrontation with the increasing involvement of the Soviet state in cultural censorship and the development of the State doctrine of Socialist realism. Works that criticized or satirized aspects of the Soviet system, such as the poem \"Talking With the Taxman About Poetry\" (1926), and the plays The Bedbug (1929) and The Bathhouse (1929), met with scorn from the Soviet state and literary establishment.\nIn 1930, Mayakovsky killed himself. Even after death, his relationship with the Soviet state remained unsteady. Though Mayakovsky had previously been harshly criticized by Soviet governmental bodies such as the  Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (RAPP), Premier Joseph Stalin described Mayakovsky after his death as \"the best and the most talented poet of our Soviet epoch\".",
