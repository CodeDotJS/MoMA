      "Introduction": "Charles Allan Gilbert (September 3, 1873 \u2013 April 20, 1929), better known as C. Allan Gilbert, was a prominent American illustrator. He is especially remembered for a widely published drawing (a memento mori or vanitas) titled All Is Vanity. The drawing employs a double image (or visual pun) in which the scene of a woman admiring herself in a mirror of her vanity table, when viewed from a distance, appears to be a human skull. The title is also a pun, as this type of dressing-table is also known as a vanity. The phrase \"All is vanity\" comes from Ecclesiastes 1:2 (\"Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.\") It refers to the vanity and pride of humans. In art, vanity has long been represented as a woman preoccupied with her beauty. And art that contains a human skull as a focal point is called a memento mori (Latin for \"remember death\"), a work that reminds people of their mortality.\nIt is less widely known that Gilbert was an early contributor to animation, and a camouflage artist (or camoufleur) for the U.S. Shipping Board during World War I.",

Interested in the empirical observation of natural phenomena, his early work integrated the viewer's image with prerecorded information. He has been described as a \"pioneer in video research [...] with an almost scientific attention for taxonomies and descriptions of ecological systems and environments\". His seminal work Wipe Cycle \u2013co-produced with Ira Schneider in 1968\u2013 is considered one of the first video installations in art history. Gillette and Schneider exhibited this early \"sculptural video installation\" in TV as a Creative Medium, the first show in the United States devoted to Video Art. In October 1969, Frank Gillette and Michael Shamberg founded the Raindance Corporation, a \"media think-tank [...] that embraced video as an alternative form of cultural communication.",
