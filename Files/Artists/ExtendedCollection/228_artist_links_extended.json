      "Introduction": "Prolific independent film- and video-maker. Kuchar began producing films with his twin brother Mike Kuchar from age 12 with an 8mm movie camera received as a birthday gift. The brothers later began making films independently of one another and George's 1966 film \"Hold Me While I'm Naked,\" became popular in the New York underground film world. His early films influenced a slightly younger generation of independent filmmakers who were inspired by his ability to create satirical but emotionally effective films on an extremely low budget. His 16mm films are narrative psychodramas, often drawing from pop culture. His work employs humor and colorful or garish production values, but often addresses the subject of loneliness or melancholy. In 1971 he secured a position teaching at the San Francisco Art Institute, which he retained until his death. His classes there provided him with the means to create films using students as cast and crew. When inexpensive consumer video cameras became available in the mid-1980s he began a series of diaristic works which he edited entirely in the camera. His influence extends to generations of independent film and video makers, and it has been said that this influence can be seen indirectly in a wave of do-it-yourself cinema that has proliferated via the Internet.",

Associated with the Anti-Art (Han-geijutsu) movement in Japan in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Kud\u043e\u0304's provocative art was nourished by lifelong interests in science, sport and everyday objects. His work often presents a radically transformed and grotesque vision of the human body, calling into question its desires and its limits, as well as its future and origins. Never having officially identified with any one group or movement throughout his international career, the artist's body of work evades art historical classification.",
