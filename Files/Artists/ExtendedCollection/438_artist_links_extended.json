      "Introduction": "Stow Wengenroth (1906\u20131978) was an American artist and lithographer, born in 1906 in Brooklyn, New York. Wengenroth was once called \"America's greatest living artist working in black and white\" by the American realist painter Andrew Wyeth, and he is generally considered to be one of the finest American lithographers of the twentieth century. He studied at the Art Students League of New York under George Bridgman and John Fabian Carlson from 1923 to 1927, then at the Grand Central School of Art under Wayman Adams. Wengenroth was elected a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters (renamed the American Academy of Arts and Letters) in 1942 and was also a member of the Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts and the Prairie Printmakers. He was elected an Associate of the prestigious National Academy of Design in 1938, and a full Academician in 1941. Wengenroth was also the author of several influential books on lithography.\nWengenroth's lithographs are found in most major American collections, including the Library of Congress, Whitney Museum of American Art, and Metropolitan Museum of Art. During his career, Wengenroth became well known for his detailed depictions of the seascapes and landscapes of New England and, in particular, Maine. As an artist, he eschewed colour in his lithographs but rather focused on shadow, light, and form to transmit detail and dimension. While his urban scenes of Manhattan and the New York City environs are especially coveted by the current market, Wengenroth was most adept at creating sincere yet vivid simulacra of the New England littoral and interior.\nLithographer and painter Elizabeth Saltonstall was one of his students.",

      "Introduction": "John Wesley (November 25, 1928 \u2013 February 10, 2022) was an American painter, known for idiosyncratic figurative works of eros and humor, rendered in a precise, hard-edged, deadpan style. Wesley's art largely remained true to artistic premises that he established in the 1960s: a comic-strip style of flat shapes, delicate black outline, a limited matte palette of saturated colors, and elegant, pared-down compositions. His characteristic subjects included cavorting nymphs, nudes, infants and animals, pastoral and historical scenes, and 1950s comic strip characters in humorously blasphemous, ambiguous scenarios of forbidden desire, rage or despair.Early on, art critics categorized Wesley as a Pop artist, due to his appropriation of the visual language and, at times, iconography of popular culture. Later critics, however, regarded him as an art outsider whose work eluded categorization, noting among other things, his psychological plumbing of a (largely male) American unconscious, formal affinities with abstraction, and wide-ranging art-historical borrowings. Artforum's Jenifer Borum described Wesley's work as combining \"a Pop vocabulary, a refined Minimal sensibility, and a surrealistic proclivity for uncanny juxtapositions,\" while Dave Hickey likened him to an eighteenth-century Rococo \"fabulist,\" citing his penchant for erotic narrative.Wesley's work has been exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art, MoMA PS1, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Portikus (Frankfurt), and the Chinati Foundation, among others. It belongs to public art collections including the Museum of Modern Art, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and Whitney Museum. In 1976, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.",

      "Introduction": "Horace Clifford Westermann (December 11, 1922 \u2013 November 3, 1981) was an American sculptor and printmaker. His sculptures frequently incorporated traditional carpentry and marquetry techniques. From the late 1950s until his death in 1981, Westermann worked with a number of materials and formal devices to address a range of personal, literary, artistic, and pop-cultural references. The artist's sculptural oeuvre is distinguished by its intricate craftsmanship, in which wood, metal, glass, and other materials are laboriously hand-tooled, and by its ability to convey an offbeat, often humorous, individualistic sensibility.\nWestermann's sculptures reveal not only the influence of craft traditions, but also of varied art historical precedents. The artist's ability to convey subtle and uncanny effects through the presentation of seemingly simple objects has often led critics to compare his work to that of Surrealist-inspired artists such as Joseph Cornell. However, Westermann's work encompasses elements from a broad and diverse range of artistic practices, including Assemblage, Dada, and Folk Art. His sculptures, moreover, point to minimal and post-minimal art of the late 1960s and beyond, in terms of their rigorous craftsmanship, formal sophistication, unconventional use of materials, and sense of humor.",
