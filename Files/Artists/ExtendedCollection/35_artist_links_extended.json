      "Introduction": "Born 15 January 1843; died 1 January 1908. Bennett was the nephew of the photographer G.H. Houghton. In 1865, Bennett purchased a photography business in Kilbourn, Wisconsin. After his death, his wife ran the business \"H.H. Bennett Studio\" until 1949 at which time it was taken over by his daughters. While Bennett's wife, Evaline Marshall Bennett ran the portrait studio, Bennett photographed the landscape around Kilbourn and the Wisconsin River. Many of Bennett's images were used for the tourist trade. He photographed for the railroad and allowed his images to be used to promote local attractions. In the 1880s Bennett produced a series of views of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and another set of stereoviews of the Winnebago Indians.",

In the early 1920s, his work began exploring American narrative themes utilizing highly stylized figurations and backgrounds. By the 30s, Benton was considered a Regionalist, and had been commissioned to paint the first of many murals, which spawned controversy because of their politics. Benton left New York City in 1935 and continued to paint socially conscious murals until the 1960s. American artist, born Mo. Comment on works: religious, allegory, genre",
