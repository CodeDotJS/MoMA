He is also the inventor of the first cracking method.\nBesides the innovations he brought to the oil industry and the construction of numerous bridges and buildings, Shukhov was the inventor of a new family of doubly curved structural forms. These forms, based on non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry, are known today as hyperboloids of revolution. Shukhov developed not only many varieties of light-weight hyperboloid towers and roof systems, but also the mathematics for their analysis. Shukhov is particularly reputed for his original designs of hyperboloid towers such as the Shukhov Tower.",

      "Introduction": "Born 10 October 1910, Shulman's images document the built environment of Southern California from the 1930s through the 21st century. He began his career photographing Richard Neutra houses in 1936. From then, he photographed the work of nearly every modernist architect working in the United States, including Rudolph Schindler, John Lautner, Frank Lloyd Wright, Bruce Goff, and Gregory Ain. His published photographs did much to promote the \"international style\" ca. 1936-1970, and illuminated the role of modernist architecture in its environmental context. His archive is held by the J. Paul Getty Trust. He passed away 15 July 2009.",

Siegel studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and studied music at the Juilliard School.Hits he composed included \"Monotonous\" (written in collaboration with June Carroll, famously performed by Eartha Kitt), \"Penny Candy\", \"Love is a Simple Thing\" and \"I Want You to Be the First One to Know\". His work was featured prominently in the Leonard Sillman-produced revues New Faces of 1952, New Faces of 1956 and New Faces of 1962.\nIn 1962, Siegel collaborated with Kaye Ballard on an LP, Peanuts, on which he played Charlie Brown and she played Lucy Van Pelt from the album's comic strip namesake by Charles M. Schulz, dramatizing a series of vignettes drawn from the strip's archive.Siegel released several recordings of himself performing his own music, including 1992's Arthur Siegel Sings Arthur Siegel and 1995's Live at the Ballroom.Siegel died at the age of 70 on September 13, 1994, at his home in Manhattan due to heart failure.",
