He holds both American and Swiss nationality.\nMarclay's work explores connections between sound, noise, photography, video, and film. A pioneer of using gramophone records and turntables as musical instruments to create sound collages, Marclay is, in the words of critic Thom Jurek, perhaps the \"unwitting inventor of turntablism.\" His own use of turntables and records, beginning in the late 1970s, was developed independently of but roughly parallel to hip hop's use of the instrument.",

Elaine de Kooning said that he was \"[w]idely recognized as one of the most gifted and erudite watercolorists in the country\".The New York Times critic Howard Devree stated in 1938 that \"Margules uses color in a breath-taking manner. A keen observer, he eliminates scrupulously without distortion of his material.\" Devree later called Margules \"one of our most daring experimentalists in the medium\"\" Margules was also a well-known participant in the bohemian culture of New York City's Greenwich Village, where he was widely known as the \"Baron\" of Greenwich Village. The New York Times described him as \"one of Greenwich Village's best-known personalities\" and \"one of the best known and most buoyant characters about Greenwich Village.\"",
