In 1938, he issued his first prints in his now famous \"Winter in Aizu\" series. Sait\u014d was one of the first Japanese printmaking artists to have won at the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennale in 1951. \nSait\u014d's early works depict villages populated with local Japanese with a high degree of realism and three-dimensionality. His more mature works merge modern elements with Japanese tradition. His prints feature architecture and plant life flattened in two-dimensionality.\nHe spent time in Paris, and did a series there. Kiyoshi Saito's woodblock prints titled  \u201cAutumn\u201d are considered extremely rare and valuable.",

      "Introduction": "Takako Saito (\u6589\u85e4 \u967d\u5b50, Sait\u014d Takako, born 1929)  is a Japanese artist closely associated with Fluxus, the international collective of avant-garde artists that was active primarily in the 1960s and 1970s. Saito contributed a number of performances and artworks to the movement, which continue to be exhibited in Fluxus exhibitions to the present day. She was also deeply involved in the production of Fluxus edition works during the height of their production, and worked closely with George Maciunas. \nSaito is best known for her special chess sets, which include Spice Chess, but her larger body of work focuses on crafting a variety of objects to be used in open-ended situations that create unexpected social relations. More recent exhibitions, such as the Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwartskunst Siegen's 2017-18 exhibition Takako Saito: You + Me, have focused on the way Saito uses a playful process-based approach focused on the making of objects to blend her artistic practice with the activities and chores of daily life. Despite the fact that this blended approach often results in ambiguous objects that sit between the experimental sentiments of fine art and the practical concerns of design, her works have been collected by major museums and public collections across Europe, the United States, and Japan. The majority of her exhibitions have been held in Europe, where she has traveled and lived since 1968. She currently lives in D\u00fcsseldorf in Germany.",

      "Introduction": "Riiko Sakkinen (born in 1976, Helsinki) is a visual artist. He currently lives in Pepino, Toledo, Spain.\nSakkinen is the founder of Turbo Realism; an art movement that uses critical irony, provocation and intervention as means of addressing sociopolitical and economic issues of the modern capitalist world through visual arts. Turbo Realism aims to pinpoint the irony within commercial and political structures and actions through reconstructing familiar imagery and multilingual vocabulary into a new combination of refined and truthful meaning beyond their original commercial use. The result is often a painting or a drawing, containing slogan-like statements, that seems joyful and ordinary at the surface but has an ironic intention of creating a feeling that something is indeed horribly wrong with the world. Sakkinen has stated his view on art through the words of Pablo Picasso: \u201dThe art is not made to decorate rooms. It is an offensive weapon in the defence against the enemy.\u201d In addition to his works on canvas and paper, Sakkinen has actively created installations, interventions and happenings as well as designed objects that combine multiple media.\nHe has held numerous solo and group shows in Europe and The United States and his works are included in the permanent collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York, Amos Anderson Art Museum and Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki. Among his most recent activity is the Rikhardinkatu Public Library intervention in Helsinki, Finland called \u201dRiiko Sakkinen's Favorite Books\u201d.",
