      "Introduction": "Frith opened a studio \"Frith & Hayward\" in Liverpool in 1850. In 1856, Frith embarked on his first of three commercial expeditions to photograph Egypt, the Nile, Pyramids, the Sphinx of Giza, Karnak, Luxor and Thebes. The second expedition was to Egypt, Syria, and Palestine from 1857 to 1858, and in 1859, Frith embarked upon the third expedition, traveling 1,500 miles up the Nile photographing monuments. In 1859, Frith returned to England and opened \"F. Frith and Company\" at Reigate in Surrey, where he produced books, portfolios of Germany, Tyrol, Switzerland, Italy, Gibraltar, Spain and Portugal, along with stereoscopic cards. Frith began to photograph Britain and its monuments in 1864. Frith is considered the first mass-producer and distributor of photographic images in England. Frith was associated with the Liverpool Photographic Society and the Architectural Photographic Association.",

Establishing his reputation as a scholar of the Old Masters, he became an advocate of more recent developments in French painting, to which he gave the name Post-Impressionism. He was the first figure to raise public awareness of modern art in Britain, and emphasised the formal properties of paintings over the \"associated ideas\" conjured in the viewer by their representational content. He was described by the art historian Kenneth Clark as \"incomparably the greatest influence on taste since Ruskin\u00a0...In so far as taste can be changed by one man, it was changed by Roger Fry\". The taste Fry influenced was primarily that of the Anglophone world, and his success lay largely in alerting an educated public to a compelling version of recent artistic developments of the Parisian avant-garde.",
