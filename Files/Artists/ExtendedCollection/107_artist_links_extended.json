In February 2013, his painting, The Architect's Home in the Ravine, sold for $12 million at a London auction. Art critic Jonathan Jones said about him: \"Amid all the nonsense, impostors, rhetorical bullshit and sheer trash that pass for art in the 21st century, Doig is a jewel of genuine imagination, sincere work and humble creativity.\"",

He served in the French army in 1940, but did not entirely give up his career as a photographer, earning a little money producing postcards. In 1949, Doisneau signed a contract for \"Vogue,\" magazine, but never had the same interest in fashion work as he did in street photography. His images are often humorous, but not with out empathy. His work remained contrast in subject and style throughout his career.",

His Cubist-style paintings fit in with the precepts of the De Stijl artists and Domela joined them, being the youngest memeber of their group. Mastering the tehchnique of graphic art on his own, Domela's typographic experimentation allowed him to join the Ring Neue Werbegestalter in Berlin. Using photomantage for his book covers and advertisements, he proclaimed photography as a contemporary medium for graphic communication. Domela organized the \"Photomontage\" exhibition at the Staatliche Kunstbibliothek, Berlin in spring 1931. With the rise of Nazism in Germany, Domela left for Paris where he established the first silkscreen printing studio for advertising. He still designed posters and magazine covers, but returned to painting in 1936.",

His subsequent termination from the government agency he worked for spurred his career as a freelance photographer. \nAs photojournalists grappled with how to depict the new social reality of the post-war period, Domon forged the realistic photography movement (Riarizumu Shashin Und\u014d). He embraced the idea of snapshot photography (sunappu), in which images could be captured with \"absolute unstagedness\". Domon documented the aftermath of the war, focusing on society and the lives of ordinary people. He received national acclaim for his portraits of children in exploitative labor conditions and Hiroshima bomb survivors (hibakusha).\nDomon was forced to abandon sunappu photography after he suffered a debilitating stroke in 1958. His major project until the end of his career was photographing temples across Japan, a much-beloved subject that he had first begun to document in 1940. These images constituted the monumental series Pilgrimage to Ancient Temples (Kojijunrei), published in five volumes from 1963 to 1975.",
