His songwriting credits include \"Different Drum\", which became a hit for Linda Ronstadt and the Stone Poneys.\nAfter the break-up of the Monkees, Nesmith continued his successful songwriting and performing career, first with the seminal country rock group the First National Band, with whom he had a top-40 hit, \"Joanne\", and then as a solo artist. He often played a custom-built Gretsch 12-string electric with the Monkees and afterwards.\nNesmith founded Pacific Arts, a multimedia production and distribution company, in 1974, through which he helped pioneer the music video format. He created one of the first American television programs dedicated to music videos, PopClips, which aired on Nickelodeon in 1980. He was asked to help produce and create MTV, but had prior commitments with his production company. In 1981, he won the first Grammy Award for Video of the Year for his hour-long television show, Elephant Parts.\nHe was also an executive producer of the film Repo Man (1984).",

He was greatly influenced by Otto Wagner and Adolf Loos. In 1912, he met Rudolph Schindler and the two were both employees of Frank Lloyd Wright. He moved to California, and in 1927 he designed the Lovell House, which featured a light steel frame and glass and sprayed concrete exterior walls, which dramatized the house\u2019s hillside location. Through his work and writing, Neutra became a prominent Modernist, being included in MOMA\u2019s 1932 exhibit on the International Style of architecture. He became known for his large-scale dwellings, such as Channel Heights housing project (1942) overlooking San Pedro in Los Angeles. Through the 1940s, his designs continued to emphasize the relationship between building and landscape, but his designs became less severe, such as the brick and redwood the Nesbitt house (1942). In partnership with Robert E. Alexander (1949-1958), he built several larger commercial and institutional buildings, including the US Embassy Building (1959) in Karachi, Pakistan. He formed a partnership with his son Dion Neutra, in 1965.",

      "Introduction": "Christopher Richard Wynne Nevinson  (13 August 1889\u00a0\u2013 7 October 1946) was an English figure and landscape painter, etcher and lithographer, who was one of the most famous war artists of World War I. He is often referred to by his initials C. R. W. Nevinson, and was also known as Richard.\nNevinson studied at the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks and alongside Stanley Spencer and Mark Gertler. When he left the Slade, Nevinson befriended Marinetti, the leader of the Italian Futurists, and the radical writer and artist Wyndham Lewis, who founded the short-lived Rebel Art Centre. However, Nevinson fell out with Lewis and the other 'rebel' artists when he attached their names to the Futurist movement. Lewis immediately founded the Vorticists, an avant garde group of artists and writers from which Nevinson was excluded.\nAt the outbreak of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit and was deeply disturbed by his work tending wounded French and British soldiers. For a very brief period he served as a volunteer ambulance driver before ill health forced his return to Britain. Subsequently, Nevinson volunteered for home service with the Royal Army Medical Corps. He used these experiences as the subject matter for a series of powerful paintings which used the machine aesthetic of Futurism and the influence of Cubism to great effect. His fellow artist Walter Sickert wrote at the time that Nevinson's painting La Mitrailleuse, 'will probably remain the most authoritative and concentrated utterance on the war in the history of painting.' In 1917, Nevinson was appointed an official war artist, but he was no longer finding Modernist styles adequate for describing the horrors of modern war, and he increasingly painted in a more realistic manner. Nevinson's later World War One paintings, based on short visits to the Western Front, lacked the same powerful effect as those earlier works which had helped to make him one of the most famous young artists working in England.\nShortly after the end of the war, Nevinson travelled to the United States of America, where he painted a number of powerful images of New York. However, his boasting and exaggerated claims of his war experiences, together with his depressive and temperamental personality, made him many enemies in both the US and Britain. In 1920, the critic Charles Lewis Hind wrote of Nevinson that 'It is something, at the age of thirty one, to be among the most discussed, most successful, most promising, most admired and most hated British artists.' His post-war career, however, was not so distinguished. Nevinson's 1937 memoir Paint and Prejudice, although lively and colourful, is in parts inaccurate, inconsistent, and misleading.",
