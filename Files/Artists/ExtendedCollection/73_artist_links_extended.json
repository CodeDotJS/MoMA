At the College of Commerce in Cologne he showed anti-National Socialist leanings and in 1942 he had a lobe of lung removed to avoid military conscription. There are conflicting reports concerning his activities from 1944 to 1947, and it is rumored that he disappeared into the Alsace and was in a concentration camp. In 1948, he changed his name to Chargesheimer, and during this time he published his first photographs of war-torn Cologne. In 1962, he turned to the theatre, working as a stage designer, director and photographer for theatres in Cologne, Vienna, Brunswick, Hamburg, Bonn, and Kassel. He continued creating controversial images of the city throughout the 1960s, but it wasn't until the 1980s that the significance of his experimental work gained recognition. He died under unknown circumstances in 1971.",

Although Ch\u00e1vez Morado took classes in California and Mexico, he is considered to be mostly self-taught. He experimented with various materials, and was an early user of Italian mosaic in monumental works. His major works include murals at the Ciudad Universitaria, Secretar\u00eda de Comunicaciones y Transportes and Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda in Mexico City as well as frescos at the Alh\u00f3ndiga de Granaditas, which took twelve years to paint. From the 1940s on, he also worked as a cultural promoter, establishing a number of cultural institutions especially in his home state of Guanajuato including the Museo de Arte Olga Costa - Jos\u00e9 Ch\u00e1vez Morado, named after himself and his wife, artist Olga Costa.",

She drafts sci-fi narratives in her film scenario and artwork imagination, crafting her own \u201cscience\u201d fiction genre of new queer cinema. From homesteading cyberspace in the 1990s to her current retreat to post net-crash BioNet zone, Cheang takes on viral love, bio hack in her current cycle of works.Over the past decade, she has emerged as a prominent figure in new media art. Cheang is one of the leading multimedia artists dealing with multidisciplinary topics.
