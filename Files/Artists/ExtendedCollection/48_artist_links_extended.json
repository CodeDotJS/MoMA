In the 1970s he shifted from painting to photography, film, video, assemblage, and installations, but he returned to painting by the end of the decade. Addressing the question of what shapes his work, Boshier once stated \"Most important is life itself, my sources tend to be current events, personal events, social and political situations, and a sense of place and places\".  His work uses popular culture and the mixing of high and low culture to confront government, revolution, sex, technology and war with subversive dark humor.He has been commissioned by David Bowie, The Clash, and The Pretty Things.",

His signature style, also known as \"Boterismo\", depicts people and figures in large, exaggerated volume, which can represent political criticism or humor, depending on the piece. He is considered the most recognized and quoted living artist from Latin America, and his art can be found in highly visible places around the world, such as Park Avenue in New York City and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris.Self-titled \"the most Colombian of Colombian artists\" early on, Botero came to national prominence when he won the first prize at the Sal\u00f3n de Artistas Colombianos in 1958. He began creating sculptures after moving to Paris in 1973, achieving international recognition with exhibitions around the world by the 1990s. His art is collected by many major international museums, corporations, and private collectors. In 2012, he received the International Sculpture Center's Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award.",

A varied artist, Bothwell was considered a part of the Bay Area Surrealist artist scene and has paintings, drawings, collages, and prints in notable museums throughout the world.  She was particularly known for her innovative use of serigraphy as a fine art form.  Born in San Francisco, California, and later raised in San Diego, California, Bothwell knew from the age of 4 that she wanted to be an artist.  As a teenager, she studied dance at the Ratliff School for Dancing. Her art career began at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) in 1921 under the tutelage of Gottardo Piazzoni and Rudolph Schaeffer. Bothwell was married to sculptor Donal Hord in 1932 but divorced shortly after likely due to her independence in traveling and difference of opinion on \"domestic duties\".",
