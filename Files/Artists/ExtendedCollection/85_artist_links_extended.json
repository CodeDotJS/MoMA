      "Introduction": "Hans Coper (8 April 1920 \u2013 16 June 1981) was an influential German-born British studio potter.  His work is often coupled with that of Lucie Rie due to their close association, even though their best known work differs dramatically, with Rie's being less sculptural, while Coper's was much more abstract, but also always functional.  The latter point was noted by M. S. Thomas in his recent book \"The Essential Potness.\" Coper always made functional vessels, principally containers for flowers (vases), fruit (bowls), candles (candle holders) including work for Coventry Cathedral and Sussex University meeting house. He made a small group of Figures in the fifties, which were not vessels and were never put on sale (see Tony Birks).",
