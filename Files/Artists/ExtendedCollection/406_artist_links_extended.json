      "Introduction": "Joan-Josep Tharrats i Vidal (1918 in Girona \u2013 2001 in Barcelona) was a Spanish painter, art theorist and publisher. \nBorn into an industrialist family, his father was the businessman and poet Josep Tharrats i Vil\u00e0. From 1932 to 1935 he lived in B\u00e9ziers, before relocating to Barcelona where he studied at the Escola Massana. The Spanish Civil War brought his studies to an end, and he wouldn't resume his art career until 1942. His initial style was akin to Impressionism but moved into abstraction as the influence of Piet Mondrian and Wassily Kandinsky became more important to him. From 1946 on he used collage techniques. In 1947 he was introduced to artists Arnau Puig Grau, Joan Pon\u00e7, Modest Cuixart, Antoni T\u00e0pies, Joan Brossa and Josep Vicen\u00e7 Foix at the Institut Fran\u00e7ais in Barcelona. With some of these artists he founded the group Dau al Set, which published the magazine of the same name, printed in his atelier.\nHe was one of the most visible artists in the local avantgarde art of the post-war years. His style evolved from lineal abstraction influenced by surrealism (during his Dau al Set years) towards Art Informel working with texture, color and graphism. His work also includes a variety of posters, books, murals, stained glass, mosaics, jewelry and opera scenography. Tamb\u00e9 va fer cartells, il\u00b7lustr\u00e0 llibres i va fer murals, vitralls, mosaics, joies i fins i tot escenografies d'\u00f2pera (Spleen de 1984).\nHe had an individual exhibition in 1949 at the El Jard\u00edn gallery in Barcelona and became one of the most important Catalan artists in the international scene.  From 1954 onwards he became a fixture of the Sala Gaspar in Barcelona and from 1955 in Stockholm and New York City. In 1959 his work was exhibited at the 5th S\u00e3o Paulo Biennale and at the Venice Biennale of 1960 and 1964. In 1966 he founded the Associaci\u00f3 d'Artistes Actuals. \nIn 2000, Tharrats himself collaborated with monumental and small oil paintings in his last exhibition which was organized by  Galeria Ta\u00fcll of Barcelona.  \nIn 2009, an important traveling exhibition called \"Les maculatures de Tharrats\" was arranged by the Cultural Department of the Diputaci\u00f3 de Barcelona.",
