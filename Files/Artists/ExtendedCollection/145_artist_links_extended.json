A self-taught artist, Gehr was inspired to begin making films in the 1960s after chancing upon a screening of a Stan Brakhage film.  Gehr's film Serene Velocity (1970) has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.  Gehr served as faculty at the San Francisco Art Institute.\nThe New York Times described Gehr's work as \"abstract, beautiful, mysterious, invigorating, utopian\" saying he had \"embraced [the] Modernist cry, shunning mainstream narrative to make films in which bubbling grain, streaks of color and pulses of light are the main attraction.\" His film Essex Street Quartet (2004) was included in the exhibition \"The Long Run\" at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, from November 11, 2017, to November 4, 2018.His films are distributed by Canyon Cinema in San Francisco.",

Gehry and Associates, Inc. in 1962, where her remains as Design Principal. His early work, such as his own Gehry House (1979), shows a deconstructionist approach, taking an older building and re-assembling it with apparently casually placed low-cost corrugated metal panels, steel poles, and a canopy of wire mesh fencing. Since the 1980s, Gehry\u2019s work has focused on the use of shiny metallic surfaces, emphasizing curving lines and the play of light and shade. The best examples are the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain (1997) and the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles (2003). In design, his approach is similar to his architecture, where disposable materials such as cardboard are used to make chairs with undulating forms that suggest elements in nature.",
