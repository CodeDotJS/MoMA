      "Introduction": "Ger van Elk (9 March 1941 \u2013 17 August 2014) was a Dutch artist who created sculptures, painted photographs, installations and film. His work has been described as being both conceptual art and arte povera. Between 1959 and 1988 he lived and worked in Los Angeles, New York City, and Amsterdam, except for a period of study in Groningen in the 1960s. In 1996 he won the J. C. van Lanschot Prize for Sculpture.Ger van Elk had several solo exhibitions at Art & Project from 1970 to 1987. This was his second serious gallery showing in Amsterdam.Together with Marinus Boezem, Wim T. Schippers and Jan Dibbets, he is seen as one of the main representatives of these movements in the Netherlands. Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven and the Tate Gallery in London have work of Van Elk in their collection. Reflections on art history are an important part of his work.",

      "Introduction": "Paul Elliman (born 1961) is a British artist and designer based in London. His work combines an interest in typography and the human voice, often referring to forms of audio signage that mediate a relationship between them. His typeface Found Fount (aka Bits) is an ongoing collection of found \u2018typography\u2019 drawn from objects and industrial debris in which no letter-form is repeated.Elliman's work has addressed the instrumentalisation of the human voice as a kind of typography, engaging the voice in many of its social and technological guises, as well as imitating other languages and random sounds of the city including the non-verbal messages of emergency vehicle sirens, radio transmissions and the muted acoustics of architectural spaces.He has exhibited in the Institute of Contemporary Arts and Tate Modern in London, the New Museum and Moma (Ecstatic Alphabets, 2012) in New York, APAP in Anyang, South Korea, and Kunsthalle Basel. In 2009 his project \"Sirens Taken for Wonders\" was commissioned for the New York biennial Performa09, and took the form of a radio discussion about the coded language of emergency vehicle sirens, as well as a series of siren-walks through the city.\nIn 2010 he contributed a series of whistled versions of bird song transcriptions by Olivier Messiaen for the show We Were Exuberant and Still Had Hope, at Marres Centre for Contemporary Art, Maastricht.Elliman is visiting critic at Yale School of Art, New Haven, and a thesis supervisor at the Werkplaats Typografie in Arnhem, Netherlands.",

He adhered to Dadaism and became one of the pillars of Surrealism by opening the way to artistic action politically committed to the Communist Party.\nDuring World War II, he was the author of several poems against Nazism that circulated clandestinely.
