      "Introduction": "Frederick Sommer (September 7, 1905 \u2013 January 23, 1999), was an artist born in Angri, Italy and raised in Brazil. He earned a M.A. degree in Landscape Architecture (1927) from Cornell University where he met Frances Elizabeth Watson (1904\u20131999) whom he married in 1928; they had no children. The Sommers moved to Tucson, Arizona in 1931 and then Prescott, Arizona in 1935. Sommer became a naturalized citizen of the United States on November 18, 1939.\nConsidered a master photographer, Sommer first experimented with photography in 1931 after being diagnosed with tuberculosis the year prior. Early works on paper (starting in 1931) include watercolors, and evolve to pen-and-ink or brush plus drawings of visually composed musical score. Concurrent to the works on paper, Sommer started to seriously explore the artistic possibilities of photography in 1938 when he acquired an 8\u00d710 Century Universal Camera, eventually encompassing the genres of still life (chicken parts and assemblage), horizonless landscapes, jarred subjects, cut-paper, clich\u00e9-verre negatives and nudes. According to art critic Robert C. Morgan, Sommer's \"most extravagant, subtle, majestic, and impressive photographs\u2014comparable in many ways to the views of Yosemite Valley\u2019s El Capitan and Half Dome by Ansel Adams\u2014were Sommer\u2019s seemingly infinite desert landscapes, some of which he referred to as 'constellations.'\"  The last artistic body of work Sommer produced (1989\u20131999) was collage based largely on anatomical illustrations.\nFrederick Sommer had significant artistic relationships with Edward Weston, Max Ernst, Aaron Siskind, Richard Nickel, Minor White, and others. His archive (of negatives and correspondence) was part of founding the Center for Creative Photography in 1975 along with Ansel Adams, Harry Callahan, Wynn Bullock, and Aaron Siskind. He taught briefly at Prescott College during the late 60s and substituted for Harry Callahan at IIT Institute of Design in 1957\u20131958 and later at the Rhode Island School of Design.\nBruce Silverstein Gallery is the New York representative of the Frederick & Frances Sommer Foundation.",

By 1857, Sommer was located in Naples, where he established a studio. That same year, he travelled to Austria and Switzerland. In 1860 Sommer formed a partnership with German photographer Edmondo Behl\u00e8s (1841-1921) in Naples. This partnership lasted until 1872. In 1861 Sommer photographed the camps and fortifications at Gaeta, Italy, Pompeii in 1863, and Capri, Messina and Rome, Italy in 1865. In 1880, Sommer photographed Palermo, Sicily, also producing views of monuments. Although based in Naples, Sommer sold views of all regions of Italy, often using negatives purchased from other photographers.",

      "Introduction": "K.R.H. Sonderborg (1923\u20132008) was a German painter, graphic artist, university professor and from 1980 for several years prorector of the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart.\nHe was born in S\u00f8nderborg/Als, Denmark.  Starting in 1953, he became a member of the group Zen 49, and studied at the Atelier 17 in St. W. Hayter in Paris. In the years spent time working in London, New York City, Tokyo, Chicago,Osaka Cornwall, Ascona, Rome and Paris.\nIn 1951 the artist Kurt Rudolf Hoffmann called himself K.R.H. Sonderborg, after the town he was born in.\nSonderborg went to school in Hamburg and completed a merchant's apprenticeship in 1939. He became a private student of the painter Ewald Becker-Carus in Hamburg in 1946. From 1947 to 1949 he studied painting, graphic art and textile design at the State Art School in Hamburg under Willem Grimm and Maria May. In 1953 he joined the artists group Zen 49. He went to Paris the same year where he received training in engraving from Stanley William Hayter in the Atelier 17. Paris is also the place where he first encounters Tachism. In the following the artist goes on longer journeys and works for some time in London, Cornwall, New York, Ascona, Rome and Paris again. In New York K.R.H. Sonderborg comes into contact with Action Painting.\nHis own style is becoming abstract, painting in swift broads strokes, that reveal the painting process, with spontaneous color application. Black and white contrasts are an important feature, later he adds colors such as cadmium red.\nK.R.H. Sonderborg takes part in the 1958 Biennale in Venice. He is awarded the Prize for Graphic Art at the Biennale in Tokyo in 1960 as well as the Great International Prize for Drawing at the 1963 Biennale in S\u00e3o Paulo. The artist shows works at the documenta in Kassel in both 1959 and 1964. From 1965 to 1990 he holds a post as professor for painting at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart. In 1969/70 he is guest lecturer at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, as well as at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1986.\nAlong with artists such as Karl Otto G\u00f6tz, Bernhard Schulze, K.R.H. Sonderborg belongs to the most important and most impressive representatives of German Informal Art.\nK.R.H. Sonderborg died in Hamburg on 18 February 2008, aged 84.",

      "Introduction": "Sonic Youth was an American rock band based in New York City and formed in 1981. Founding members Thurston Moore (guitar, vocals), Kim Gordon (bass, vocals, guitar) and Lee Ranaldo (guitar, vocals) remained together for the entire history of the band, while Steve Shelley (drums) followed a series of short-term drummers in 1985, rounding out the core line-up. Jim O'Rourke (bass, keyboards, guitar) was also a member of the band from 1999 to 2005, and Mark Ibold (bass, guitar) was a member from 2006 to 2011.\nSonic Youth emerged from the experimental no wave art and music scene in New York before evolving into a more conventional rock band and becoming a prominent member of the American noise rock scene. Sonic Youth have been praised for having \"redefined what rock guitar could do\" using a wide variety of unorthodox guitar tunings while preparing guitars with objects like drum sticks and screwdrivers to alter the instruments' timbre. The band was a pivotal influence on the alternative and indie rock movements.\nAfter gaining a large underground following and critical praise through releases with SST Records in the late 1980s, the band experienced mainstream success throughout the 1990s and 2000s after signing to major label DGC in 1990 and headlining the 1995 Lollapalooza festival. The band disbanded in 2011 following the separation and subsequent divorce of Gordon and Moore with their final live shows taking place in Brazil. The members have since asserted that the band is finished and would not reunite.",
