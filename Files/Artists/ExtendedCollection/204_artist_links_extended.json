      "Introduction": "Originally from Florence, South Carolina, Johnson spent much of his adult life traveling, and completed hundreds of oils, watercolors, gouaches, pen-and-ink sketches, block prints, silk screens, and ceramics during his career, which spanned a gamut of styles from the academic, through Impressionism, Cubism, Fauvism, and German Expressionism. Johnson left Florence around 1918 and moved to New York where he enrolled in the National Academy of Design and worked with the painter Charles Hawthorne. In 1926 Hawthorne raised funds to send Johnson abroad to study. He traveled in Europe beginning in 1926 and returned to New York in 1929. He returned to Europe and married Holcha Krake, a Danish textile artist, and settled in Denmark. They returned to the US in 1938, where he adopted a self-consciously vernacular style marked by vivid colors and flat compositions, drawing from African sculpture and African-American models for inspiration. His new subject matter included Harlem life, the rural south, and religious scenes. He attacked racism, and depicted African-American heroes and historical figures. After the death of his wife in 1944, he began a decline into mental illness and eventually ceased to produce art.",

      "Introduction": "Grace Beverly Jones  (born 19 May 1948) is a Jamaican-American model, singer and actress. Born in Jamaica, she and her family moved to Syracuse, New York, when she was a teenager. Jones began her modelling career in New York state, then in Paris, working for fashion houses such as Yves St. Laurent and Kenzo, and appearing on the covers of Elle and Vogue. She notably worked with photographers such as Jean-Paul Goude, Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer, and became known for her distinctive androgynous appearance and bold features.\nBeginning in 1977, Jones embarked on a music career, securing a record deal with Island Records and initially becoming a high-profile figure of New York City's Studio 54-centered disco scene. In the early 1980s, she moved toward a new wave style that drew on reggae, funk, post-punk, and pop music, frequently collaborating with both the graphic designer Jean-Paul Goude and the musical duo Sly & Robbie. She scored Top 40 entries on the UK Singles Chart with \"Private Life\", \"Pull Up to the Bumper\", \"I've Seen That Face Before\", and \"Slave to the Rhythm\". In 1982, she released the music video collection A One Man Show, directed by Goude, which earned her a nomination for Best Video Album at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards. Her most popular albums include Warm Leatherette (1980), Nightclubbing (1981), and Slave to the Rhythm (1985).\nAs an actress, Jones appeared in several indie films prior to landing her first mainstream appearance as Zula in the fantasy-action film Conan the Destroyer (1984) alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sarah Douglas, and subsequently appeared in the James Bond movie A View to a Kill (1985) as May Day, and starred as a vampire in Vamp (1986); all of which earned her nominations for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 1992, Jones acted in  the Eddie Murphy film Boomerang, and contributed to the soundtrack. She also appeared alongside Tim Curry in the 2001 film Wolf Girl.\nJones was ranked 82nd on VH1's 100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll (1999). In 2008, she was honored with a Q Idol Award. Jones influenced the cross-dressing movement of the 1980s and has been cited as an inspiration for multiple artists, including Annie Lennox, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Solange, Lorde, R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy, Brazilian Girls, Nile Rodgers, Santigold, and Basement Jaxx. In 2016, Billboard ranked her as the 40th greatest dance club artist of all time.",
