He coined the term Cinema of Transgression in 1985 to describe a loose-knit group of like-minded filmmakers and artists using shock value and black humor in their work. These filmmakers and artistic collaborators included Richard Kern, Tessa Hughes Freeland, Lung Leg, Kembra Pfahler, and Lydia Lunch. Under numerous pen names, Zedd edited and wrote the Underground Film Bulletin (1984\u20131990) which publicized the work of these filmmakers. The Cinema of Transgression was explored in Jack Sargeant's book Deathtripping.",

The influence of Iranian Shi'ite folk art was seen in his exhibition at the Third Tehr\u0101n Biennale; the works were made up of geometric shapes and decorated with calligraphy. In fact, the term Saqqakhana was first used by the Iranian critic Karim Emami to describe Zenderoudi's art. Zenderoudi's interest in calligraphy was developed further in his works of the late 1960s and 1970s.",
