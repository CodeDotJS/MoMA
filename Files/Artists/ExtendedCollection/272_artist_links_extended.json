      "Introduction": "Alexander Melamid (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0301\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041c\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0301\u0434) (born July 14, 1945) is a Russian-born Conceptualist and performance artist.\nMelamid was born into a Jewish family of Daniel Melamid, a Soviet historian living in Moscow. In his early life, he attended the Stroganov Art Institute, where he collaborated with Vitaly Komar in the Russian Sots art movement (a parallel to the Western pop art movement).  Known as a cynical Social Realist, Melamid began collaborating with Komar in the late 1960s; the two emigrated together to New York City from the Soviet Union in 1977. The duo created collaborative works as \"Komar and Melamid\". In 2003, the two artists decided to go their separate ways. Around this time, Melamid's first-born son, Dan, introduced him to the world of hip-hop, which included his clients and close friends Whoo Kid and 50 Cent. Melamid was intrigued by hip-hop society because of its rich history and world appeal, and began to paint the hip-hop portraits that have become his first solo exhibition since splitting with Komar, on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit.Alexander is currently working in Chelsea, NYC at his Art Healing Ministry. Recent new series of works include \"Heaven and Hell\" and \"The Art of Plumbing.\"",

He led many technical and narrative developments in the earliest days of cinema.\nM\u00e9li\u00e8s was well known for the use of special effects, popularizing such techniques as substitution splices, multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand-painted colour. He was also one of the first filmmakers to use storyboards. His films include A Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Impossible Voyage (1904), both involving strange, surreal journeys somewhat in the style of Jules Verne, and are considered among the most important early science fiction films, though their approach is closer to fantasy.",

      "Introduction": "Leopoldo M\u00e9ndez (June 30, 1902 \u2013 February 8, 1969) was one of Mexico's most important graphic artists and one of that country's most important artists from the 20th century. M\u00e9ndez's work mostly focused on engraving for illustrations and other print work generally connected to his political and social activism. His most influential work was connected to organizations such as the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios and the Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular creating propaganda related to the ideals of the Mexican Revolution and against the rise of Fascism in the 1930s. Despite his importance in 20th-century artistic and political circles, M\u00e9ndez was a relatively obscure figure during his life, and remains so afterwards. The reasons for this generally relate to the fact that he believed in working collaboratively and anonymously for the good of society rather than for monetary gain and because the socialist and communist themes of his work fell out of favor with later generations. Despite this, he has received some posthumous recognition with Mexican scholarship considering him to be the successor to graphics artist Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada.",
