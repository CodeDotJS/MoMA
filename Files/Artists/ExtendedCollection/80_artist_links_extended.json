      "Introduction": "Cocteau considered himself a poet above all but worked in virtually every medium, including the theater and film. Some of his most important works include the poem L\u2019Ange Heurtebise (1925); the play Orph\u00e9e (1926); and the novels Les Enfants terribles (1929) and La Machine infernale (1934). His films included Le Sang d\u2019un po\u00e8te (1930) and La Belle et la b\u00eate (1946). His early life was spent in the thrall of the theater, but around 1916 he began associating with avant-garde painters and composers. His collaboration on the ballet Parade (1917) with Picasso, Satie, and Massine evolved from his personal association with both Serge Diaghilev and Picasso, whom Cocteau greatly admired.",
