Ruby's Heart, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, is an example of this recurring minimalist subject.  Stackhouse's work has been featured in one-man exhibitions in museums such as the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and his work has been compared to that of Harriet Feigenbaum.The artist Mary Beth Edelson lived with Stackhouse for 27 years.",
