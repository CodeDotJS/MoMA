For the next 60 years, Bu\u00f1uel pursued his career in his native Spain, in France, in the United States, and in Mexico. He generally worked within the limitations of the film industry while including personal, frank expressions of his own obsessions, and is noted for having been influenced by Freudian psychoanalysis and having abandoned religion. Best remembered for his early Surrealist films and for his work in the Mexican commercial cinema, Bu\u00f1uel's prolific career is distinguished for his highly personal style and controversial obsession with social injustice, religious excess, gratuitous cruelty, and eroticism.",

He married, moved to a suburb of Buffalo, and began working as a designer of a wallpaper firm in 1922. Painting full-time by 1929, his works became larger, and he concentrated on realist, urban subjects, such as the industry around Buffalo. In 1936-1937, Fortune magazine commissioned Burchfield to paint railway yards and coal mines. During his later period, from 1943-1967, his works became more expressionist, evoking his pantheist beliefs.  Comment on works: Landscapes",

In his later works, he returned to physical sculpture and installation, often critical of power structures, but at times playful and popular with broader audiences, such as his 'Urban Light' and 'Metropolis II' installations at LACMA in Los Angeles.",

He is accredited with having introduced modernist landscape architecture to Brazil. He was known as a modern nature artist and a public urban space designer. His work had a great influence on tropical garden design in the 20th century. Water gardens were a popular theme in his work. He was deftly able to transfer traditional artistic expressions such as graphic design, tapestry and folk art into his landscape designs. He also designed fabrics, jewellery and stage sets. \nHe was one of the first people to call for the conservation of Brazil's rainforests. More than 50 plants bear his name. He amassed a substantial collection of plants at his home, including more than 500 philodendrons, including some that were discovered by him or bear his name, like Philodendron burle-marxii.",
