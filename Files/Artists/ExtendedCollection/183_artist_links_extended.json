She is best known for her work of the Weimar period, when she was one of the originators of photomontage. Photomontage, or fotomontage, is a type of collage in which the pasted items are actual photographs, or photographic reproductions pulled from the press and other widely produced media.H\u00f6ch's work was intended to dismantle the fable and dichotomy that existed in the concept of the \"New Woman\": an energetic, professional, and androgynous woman, who is ready to take her place as man's equal. Her interest in the topic was in how the dichotomy was structured, as well as in who structures social roles.\nOther key themes in H\u00f6ch's works were androgyny, political discourse, and shifting gender roles. These themes all interacted to create a feminist discourse surrounding H\u00f6ch's works, which encouraged the liberation and agency of women during the Weimar Republic (1919\u20131933) and continuing through to today.",

      "Introduction": "An accomplished painter, printmaker, photographer, and scenographer, David Hockney is probably one of the most versatile British artists of the 20th century. Between 1953 and 1957, he studied at the Bradford School of Art, producing portraits and observations of his surroundings. He began his post-doctorate studies at the Royal College of Art London in 1959, where he turned first to the discipline of drawing from life. Throughout his career, the human figure would prove to be Hockney's preferred subject matter. During the 1960s, Hockney developed his own personal vision of Pop Art, interjecting playful and ironic elements. In his swimming pool pictures, Hockney juxtaposes accurate renditions of the human form with abstract renditions of water. His photographic work remained unknown to the public until the 1980s, which were then exhibited worldwide. In these works he creates collages of images taken with a Polaroid SX 70 using a cubist idiom. Time, picture surface, repetition, and shifting planes characterize these works.",
