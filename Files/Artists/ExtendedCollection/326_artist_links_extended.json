      "Introduction": "Julius Popp (born 1973, Nuremberg) is an artist based in Leipzig.\n\nHis work often uses technology, resulting in interdisciplinary ventures which reach across the boundaries of art and science.  An example of Popp\u2019s work is Bitfall (2005):  a machine which displays words selected from the internet via drops of falling water in precise configuration, each word visible only for a second. A bit.fall installation was at the London 2012 Olympic Park under the footbridge between the main entrance and stadium, the words generated using water from the Waterworks River were chosen at random from internet news feeds.Popp studied at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Grafik und Buchkunst in Leipzig and he won the Robot Choice Award in 2003.  The Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Bonn, and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT have both studied elements of Popp\u2019s work which made unique advances in the field of artificial intelligence.",

In 1940, Porter began to specialize in colour photography. From 1944 to 1946, Porter worked as a freelance landscape and wildlife photographer in Winnetka, Illinois. In 1946, Porter settled in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he photographed birds for Audubon Magazine. In 1955-1956, Porter travelled to Mexico with photographer Ellen Auerbach to photograph Mexican churches. From 1967 to 1971, Porter took three photographic trips to Greece and Turkey. Porter undertook three expeditions to photograph in Antarctica from 1975 to 1977. Many of his nature photographs are firmly linked with the Sierra Club and its promotion of conservation causes. He died 2 November 1990.",

    "details": {
      "Introduction": "Fairfield Porter (June 10, 1907 \u2013 September 18, 1975) was an American painter and art critic. He was the fourth of five children of James Porter, an architect, and Ruth Furness Porter, a poet from a literary family.  He was the brother of photographer Eliot Porter and the brother-in-law of federal Reclamation Commissioner Michael W. Straus.\nWhile a student at Harvard, Porter majored in fine arts; he continued his studies at the Art Students' League when he moved to New York City in 1928.  His studies at the Art Students' League predisposed him to produce socially relevant art and, although the subjects would change, he continued to produce realist work for the rest of his career. He would be criticized and revered for continuing his representational style in the midst of the Abstract Expressionist movement.His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists, many of them affiliated with the New York School of writers, including John Ashbery, Frank O'Hara, and James Schuyler. Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on Great Spruce Head Island, Maine and the family home at 49 South Main Street, Southampton, New York.\nHis painterly vision, which encompassed a fascination with nature and the ability to reveal extraordinariness in ordinary life, was heavily indebted to the French painters Pierre Bonnard and \u00c9douard Vuillard. John Ashbery wrote of him: \"Characteristically, [Porter] tended to prefer the late woolly Vuillards to the early ones everyone likes\".Porter said once, \"When I paint, I think that what would satisfy me is to express what Bonnard said Renoir told him: 'make everything more beautiful.'\"",
