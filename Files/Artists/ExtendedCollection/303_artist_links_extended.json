Okamoto and Kurt Seligmann developed their own theory of 'Neo-Concretism.' While in Paris Okamoto also attended classes in ethnology at the Sorbonne. He was influenced by the Surrealists in Paris and associated with Breton, Aragon and Ernst. He later published writings on Buddhist mysticism and created a theory of 'Non-Sense.' The Nazi occupation of Paris in 1940 caused his return to Japan, where he became an important influence on Japanese art after the war. In the 1950s he produced ceramic tile murals for public spaces in Tokyo.",

She was an American painter, trained in Chicago and New York where she came into contact with modern developments in art, as well as non-western traditions and photography. Her husband, the photographer Alfred Steiglitz showed her work yearly until his death in 1946. O'Keeffe is best known for extreme close-up images of abstracted natural forms, such as flowers, animal bones, clouds, and landscapes. From 1929 she spent most of her summers painting in New Mexico, moving there permanently in 1949. In 1971, she learned to be a hand-potter.  Comment on works: Landscapes",

He quickly became involved in performance art after moving to New York and meeting many performance artists. By 1959, he had created drawings and collages of common objects and renderings of grotesque human figures. He created The Store in his studio, a performance space that re-created a neighborhood of shops that displayed goods that were made of plaster. He emerged as a leading Pop artist, combining consumer culture into his own sculptures. Oldenburg married artist Coosje van Bruggen in 1977. The two collaborated on many large-scale projects together and with architect Frank O. Gehry in the mid-1970s and early 1990s.",
