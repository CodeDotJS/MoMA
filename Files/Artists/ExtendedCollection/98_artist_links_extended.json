      "Introduction": "Jos\u00e9 Mariano de Creeft (November 27, 1884\u00a0- September 11, 1982) was a Spanish-born American artist, sculptor, and teacher known for modern sculpture in stone, metal, and wood, particularly figural works of women. His 16-foot (4.9\u00a0m) bronze Alice in Wonderland sculpture climbing sculpture in Central Park is well known to both adults and children in New York City. He was an early adopter, and prominent exponent of the direct carving approach to sculpture. He also developed the technique of lead chasing, and was among the first to create modern sculpture from found objects. He taught at Black Mountain College, the Art Students League of New York, and the New School for Social Research. His works are in the Whitney Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and many other public and private collections.",

      "Introduction": "Gino De Dominicis (Ancona, 1947 \u2013 Rome, 29 November 1998) was an Italian artist. \nControversial protagonist of Italian art after the Second World War, he used various techniques and defined himself as a painter, sculptor, philosopher and architect. His work tends to become independent of both fashions and neo-avant-garde groups. Therefore, it cannot be framed in a specific artistic current: neither in Arte Povera, nor in the Transavanguardia, nor in the conceptual art, which rejected.\nHe surrounded himself with an aura of mystery and unavailability, savoring both exhibitions and public appearances. His reputation developed as much out of an absence as from a presence: he avoided the press and refused to have any of his works reproduced photographically.\nHis first show was at Rome's Galleria L'Attico in 1969.\nIn 1970, he published his Letter on Immortality, a theoretical enunciation of his research, focussing on the theme of time and the conquest of physical immortality, on the subtle confine between visible and invisible. In November 1970 De Dominicis presented at Franco Toselli Gallery in Milan a series of works as the ball, the stone and the invisible cylinder, but also the radioactive object, two identical jars and a cat with a tag announcing the postulate of the \"Second Immortality Solution\".",
