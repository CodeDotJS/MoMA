He was a key member of, and influence on, Fluxus, the international group of avant-garde artists centred on George Maciunas, having been involved with the group from the first performances in Wiesbaden 1962 until Maciunas' death in 1978.\nOne of the originators of participatory art, in which the artwork can only be experienced by the active involvement of the viewer, he is most famous for his Event Scores such as Drip Music 1962, and is widely seen as an important precursor to conceptual art. He described his own art as a way of \u201censuring that the details of everyday life, the random constellations of objects that surround us, stop going unnoticed.\u201d",

Drawing implements have included 12-gauge shotguns, the guts of electric frying pans, modified turntables, razor blades, and power sanders.\nBreuer\u2019s photographic techniques include recent works on chromogenic paper to early black-and-white photograms, gum bichromate prints, silkscreens, artist books, and unlimited newsprint editions.\nBreuer was born in Landshut. He received a degree in photography from Lette-Verein Berlin in 1988 and later attended Hochschule Darmstadt\u2013University of Applied Sciences, graduating with an advanced degree in photography in 1992. He is the recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship. He has been a guest lecturer at the Yale School of Art, Rutgers University, Princeton University, and the San Francisco Art Institute, among others; and has taught photography at New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts, and in the MFA program at Bard College.
