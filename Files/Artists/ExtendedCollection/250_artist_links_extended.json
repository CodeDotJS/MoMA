      "Introduction": "Morris Louis received his degree from the Maryland Institute of Fine and Applied Arts in Baltimore in 1933. He began by painting in a cubist style that he later abandoned in favor of post-painterly abstraction. In 1936, Louis moved to New York and befriended Leonard Bocour, who developed a special acrylic-resin Magna paint for him. Active in New York and Washington D.C., Louis is also considered one of the Washington color painters.",

Self-taught, she was inspired by her religious faith and by stained-glass church windows and other religious art.  The intensity of her images, both in colour and replicative design, is sometimes interpreted as a reflection of her own psyche, walking a tightrope between ecstasy and mental illness.",
