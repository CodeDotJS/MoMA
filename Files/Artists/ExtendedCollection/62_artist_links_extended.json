      "Introduction": "Originally trained as an abstract painter, Cage abandoned the medium in favor of composition, which he studied with Henry Cowell and Arnold Schoenberg. In the 1940s, becoming interested in expanding the range of percussive instruments, he developed the \"prepared piano\", composing works for a piano with various objects placed between the strings. After studying Zen Buddhism, Cage began to work toward a new theory of composition, focusing on removing intention and personal taste, with attention paid to the process and the element of chance. Regarding silence on equal terms as structured sound and noise, in 1952 Cage produced 4'33\", a composition in which no sound is made. Cage was a strong influence and a collaborator with many visual artists, and including his life partner the dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham.",

Cahun is best known as a writer and self-portraitist, who assumed a variety of performative personae.\nIn her writing she consistently referred to herself as \"elle\" (she), and this article follows her practice; but she also said that her actual gender was fluid. For example, in Disavowals, Cahun writes: \"Masculine? Feminine? It depends on the situation. Neuter is the only gender that always suits me.\" Cahun is most well known for her androgynous appearance, which challenged the strict gender roles of her time.\nDuring World War II, Cahun was also active as a resistance worker and propagandist.",

      "Introduction": "Calder graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology in 1919 with a degree in mechanical engineering. After taking classes at the Arts Students League, he became a freelance artist and illustrator, and published a book titled Animal Sketching. In the 1920s, Calder began traveling to Paris, where he was exposed to modernist tendencies in art. In 1930, after visiting Piet Mondrian's studio, where he was impressed by the studio environment, he began to create Comment on works: abstract, moving constructions, coined \u201cmobiles\u201d by Marcel Duchamp in 1931, for which he is most known. From the 1930s onward, Calder divided his time between trips abroad and his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, and as his commissions grew more frequent, his mobiles became increasingly gigantic. Examples are Flamingo, the stabile at Federal Center Plaza in Chicago, and L\u2019Araign\u00e9e rouge, at the Rond Point de La D\u00e9fense M\u00e9tro station in Paris.. Comment on works: abstract",
