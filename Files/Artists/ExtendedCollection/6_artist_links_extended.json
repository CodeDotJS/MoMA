      "Introduction": "Ricci Albenda (born 1966) is an American contemporary visual artist and sculptor. He specializes in three-dimensional representations of distorted architectural spaces and walls of words. His work has been covered by the New York Times repeatedly, which said \"[t]he effect is cool, weird, magical\" about a project in PS1 and \"it's a warped, sexualized, through-the-looking-glass version of the chaste but uninnocent 'white cube' space of modern art\" about the reviewed work which, however, \"doesn't look nearly as good, but it shares similar features, and is based on ambitious ideas\"; \"very fetching;\" \"the words come and go, and the wall seems to buckle and swell.\"  He received his MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1988. He is represented by the Andrew Kreps Gallery.\nHe had a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York from November 16, 2001 to January 22, 2002. On Friday March 21, 2008, he opened his back yard to the public as an adjunct to an exhibition at the Horticultural Society of New York.",

      "Introduction": "Born 19 March 1888; died 25 March 1976. Albers trained as an art teacher at K\u00f6nigliche Kunstschule in Berlin, Germany, from 1913 to 1915. From 1916 to 1919 he began his work as a printmaker at the Kunstgewerbschule in nearby Essen, Germany. In 1919 he went to Munich, Germany, to study at the K\u00f6nigliche Bayerische Akademie der Bildenden Kunst, where he was a pupil of Max Doerner and Frank Stuck. In 1920 he attended the preliminary course (Vorkurs) at the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany, and was appointed a master in 1923 or 1925. In 1925 Albers moved with the Bauhaus to Dessau, Germany, where he was named master. From 1928 to 1930 he was also in charge of the furniture workshop. In 1932 he moved with the Bauhaus to Berlin. From 1933, after the closure of the Bauhaus in Berlin, until 1949, Albers taught at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. From 1948 to 1950 or from 1950 to 1958, Albers was professor and chairman of the Department of Design at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. He remained there as a visiting professor until 1960. After his retirement from Yale University, Albers continued to live in New Haven and to paint, monitor his own exhibitions and publications, write, lecture and work on large commissioned sculptures for architectural settings. He was highly regarded as a teacher and is considered influential for the generation of artists emerging in the 1950s and 1960s. Comment on works: abstract",

Due to his technique and dark subject matter, he is often categorized among the Magic Realists and is sometimes referred to as the \"master of the macabre\".From a family of artists and artisans, Albright emerged on the American art scene in the 1930s and established a reputation as one of the most enigmatic of the American Realists. He shocked, awed and upset the viewing public through his emphasis on the fragility of the body, flesh and the human condition with such works as The Lineman (1928), That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do (The Door) (1931), and The Picture of Dorian Gray (1943). His work to highlight the minute detail and texture of every surface often required him to spend years or decades on a single painting.While Albright's works can be found in museums throughout the United States, the most important repository of his works is at the Art Institute of Chicago.",
