      "Introduction": "Gunta St\u00f6lzl (5 March 1897 \u2013 22 April 1983) was a German textile artist who played a fundamental role in the development of the Bauhaus school's weaving workshop, where she created enormous change as it transitioned from individual pictorial works to modern industrial designs.  She was one of a small number of female teachers on the Bauhaus' staff and the first to hold the title of \"Master\".\nHer textile work is thought to typify the distinctive style of Bauhaus textiles.  She joined the Bauhaus as a student in 1919, became a junior master in 1927.  She was dismissed for political reasons in 1931, two years before the Bauhaus closed under pressure from the Nazis.\nThe textile department was a neglected part of the Bauhaus when St\u00f6lzl began her career, and its active masters were weak on the technical aspects of textile production.  She soon became a mentor to other students and reopened the Bauhaus dye studios in 1921.  After a brief departure, St\u00f6lzl became the school's weaving director in 1925 when it relocated from Weimar to Dessau and expanded the department to increase its weaving and dyeing facilities.  She applied ideas from modern art to weaving, experimented with synthetic materials, and improved the department's technical instruction to include courses in mathematics.  The Bauhaus weaving workshop became one of its most successful facilities under her direction.",

      "Introduction": "Louis Clyde Stoumen (July 15, 1917 \u2013 September 20, 1991), known as Lou Stoumen, was an American photographer, film director and producer. He won two Academy Awards; the first in 1957 for Best Documentary Short Subject (The True Story of the Civil War), and the second in 1963 for Best Documentary Feature (Black Fox: The Rise and Fall of Adolf Hitler).\nStoumen was born in Springtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and died in Sebastopol, California. After graduating from Lehigh University in 1939, he worked as a freelance journalist and photographer in New York. Many of the photographs of Times Square he made were published in the 1985 book Times Square: 45 Years of Photographs.Stoumen taught at UCLA Film School. He spoke of his innovation in The True Story of the Civil War. He invented a track for the camera to move back and forth over historic photos and paintings. It also tracked up and down (in and out). The technique is often referred to today as the \"Ken Burns effect\".Stoumen received Colin Higgins' master's thesis, a screenplay called Harold and Maude. Stoumen spoke of his enjoyment of the writing, but doubted it would ever be produced. He wasn't unhappy when proven wrong by the film's success.\nStouman married Lini De Vries in 1943; the couple divorced in 1949.\nAfter his death in 1991, the Stoumen Estate gifted the entire archive of Stoumen's work, including copyright, to the Museum of Photographic Arts. MOPA created a special exhibition and catalog entitled Seduced by Life: The Art of Lou Stoumen in celebration of acquiring the Stoumen Archive. Copyright for Stoumen's work is currently administered by the Museum of Photographic Arts.The Academy Film Archive preserved The True Story of the Civil War and T Is for Tumbleweed by Stoumen.",
