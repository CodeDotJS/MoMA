      "Introduction": "John Hamilton Bush  (March 20, 1909\u00a0\u2013\u00a0January 24, 1977) was a Canadian abstract painter. A member of Painters Eleven, his paintings are associated with the Color Field movement and Post-painterly Abstraction. Inspired by Henri Matisse and American abstract expressionist painters like Helen Frankenthaler and Morris Louis, Bush encapsulated joyful yet emotional feelings in his vibrant paintings, comparing them to jazz music. Clement Greenberg described him as a \"supreme colorist\", along with Kenneth Noland in 1984.",

      "Introduction": "Solomon D. Butcher (January 24, 1856 \u2013 March 18, 1927) was an itinerant photographer who spent most of his life in central Nebraska, in the Great Plains region of the United States.  A settler under the Homestead Act, he began in 1886 to produce a photographic record of the history of white settlement in the region.  Over 3,000 of his negatives survive; more than 1,000 of these depict sod houses.  Butcher wrote two books incorporating his photographs: Pioneer History of Custer County and Short Sketches of Early Days in Nebraska (1901), and Sod Houses, or the Development of the Great American Plains (1904).\nButcher was unable to achieve financial success as a farmer, as a photographer, or in a number of other schemes later in his life, and at the time of his death felt that he had been a failure.  However, the number and scope of his photographs of Nebraska pioneer life have made them a valuable resource to students of that period of history, and they have become a staple of historical texts and popular works alike.  His oeuvre has been described as \"the most important chronicle of the saga of homesteading in America\".",

      "Introduction": "Reginald Cotterell Butler (28 April 1913 \u2013 23 October 1981) was an English sculptor. He was born at Bridgefoot House, Buntingford, Hertfordshire to Frederick William Butler (1880\u20131937) and Edith (1880\u20131969), daughter of blacksmith William Barltrop, of The Forge, Takeley, Essex. His parents were the Master and Matron of the Buntingford Union Workhouse. Frederick Butler, formerly a police constable, was a relative of the poet William Butler Yeats; Edith was of Anglo-French descent.Butler studied and lectured at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London from 1937 to 1939. He was a conscientious objector during the Second World War, being exempted from military service conditional upon setting up a small blacksmith business repairing farm implements. After winning the 'Unknown Political Prisoner' competition in 1953 he became one of the best known sculptors during the 1950s and 1960s, and also taught at the Slade School of Art.\nButler's later work consists of lifelike models of female figures, such as Girl on a Round Base,  that have something in common with Hans Bellmer and the sculpture of Allen Jones and prefigure the work of Ron Mueck.\nMany of his works are held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and Tate Gallery in London.\nButler was featured in the 1964 documentary film, \"5 British Sculptors (Work and Talk)\", by American filmmaker Warren Forma.\nButler married Joan Child in 1938; by his second wife, Rosemary (n\u00e9e Young; 1930\u20132019), a sculptor, who had been his student and later assistant, he had a son, Creon Adrian John Cotterell Butler, later a diplomat, and daughter, Cortina Maxine Ann Cotterell Butler, a director of literature for the British Council.He died in Berkhamsted.",
