      "Introduction": "Dan Perjovschi is an artist, writer and cartoonist born on 29 October 1961 in Sibiu, Romania.\nPerjovschi has over the past decade created drawings in museum spaces, most recently in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in which he created the drawing during business hours for patrons to see. The drawings present a political commentary in response to current events. Another exhibition of Perjovschi's within a Portuguese bank consists of several comic strip style drawings which address more European issues such as Romania's acceptance to the EU and abortion legalization in Portugal.\nDan and Lia Perjovschi had their first retrospective exhibition at the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University in fall 2007.\nIn 2009 Dan Perjovschi created his first permanent realisation in Czech National Library of Technology in Prague. It consists of 200 monumental drawings on the concrete walls of main atrium of the building.\nIn 2010, Dan Perjovschi served as an International Artist in Residence at the University of Kansas Spencer Museum of Art in Lawrence, Kansas. He created an installation in the Museum's Central Court and engaged with students from various departments at KU.In March 2013 Dan and Lia Perjovschi were awarded with the European Cultural Foundation's Princess Margriet Award.\nHis work is reflecting social and civic issues of interest and as such it is often printed out and used during protests.",

      "Introduction": "Sir Grayson Perry  (born 1960) is an English contemporary artist, writer and broadcaster. He is known for his ceramic vases, tapestries, and cross-dressing, as well as his observations of the contemporary arts scene, and for dissecting British \"prejudices, fashions and foibles\".Perry's vases have classical forms and are decorated in bright colours, depicting subjects at odds with their attractive appearance. There is a strong autobiographical element in his work, in which images of Perry as \"Claire\", his female alter-ego, and \"Alan Measles\", his childhood teddy bear, often appear.\nHe has made a number of documentary television programmes and has curated exhibitions. He has published two autobiographies, Grayson Perry: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Girl (2007) and The Descent of Man (2016), written and illustrated a graphic novel, Cycle of Violence (2012), written a book about art, Playing to the Gallery (2014), and published his illustrated Sketchbooks (2016). Various books describing his work have been published. In 2013 he delivered the BBC Reith Lectures.Perry has had solo exhibitions at the Bonnefantenmuseum, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, the Barbican Centre, the British Museum\nand the Serpentine Gallery in London, the Arnolfini in Bristol, The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, and the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan. His work is held in the permanent collections of \nthe British Council and Arts Council, Crafts Council, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Tate and Victoria and Albert Museum, London.He was awarded the Turner Prize in 2003. He was interviewed about the win and resulting press in Sarah Thornton's Seven Days in the Art World. In 2008 he was ranked number 32 in The Daily Telegraph's list of the \"100 most powerful people in British culture\". In 2012, Perry was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork\u2014the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover\u2014to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life.",
