His early work builds on the formalist elements of Le Corbusier, but he also added colored architectural elements. By the mid-1970s, his work became increasingly classical and historicist in nature, borrowing from Ledoux, Boull\u00e9e, Ingres, Poussin, and Classical Greece and Rome.",

He was one of the earliest Modern artists from the Pacific Northwest to achieve national and international acclaim. His style, referred to by some reviewers as Mysticism, used the muted tones of the Northwest environment, Asian aesthetics and philosophy, and a personal iconography of birds, flowers, chalices, and other images to explore the nature of consciousness.\nAn article in a 1953 issue of Life magazine cemented Graves' reputation as a major figure of the 'Northwest School' of artists. He lived and worked mostly in Western Washington, but spent considerable time traveling and living in Europe and Asia, and spent the last several years of his life in Loleta, California.",

He and his wife, artist Gertrude Glass Greene, were heavily involved in political activism to promote mainstream acceptance of abstract art and were founding members of the American Abstract Artists organization. His early style was completely non-objective. Juan Gris and Piet Mondrian as well as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse influenced his early style. From the 1940s his work \"opened out to the light and space of natural form.\" He painted landscapes and figure. \"He discerned the pain of a man, and hewed to it integrally from beginning to end\u2026. In his study of the figure he did not stress anatomical shape but rather its intuitive, often conflicting spirit.\"Balcomb Greene contributed to modernist cause through his writings: \"It is actually the artist, and only he, who is equipped for approaching the individual directly. The abstract artist can approach man through the most immediate of aesthetic experiences, touching below consciousness and the veneer of attitudes, contacting the whole ego rather than the ego on the defensive.\"",
