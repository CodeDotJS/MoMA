After studying Louis D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Blanquart-Evrard's modifications to William Henry Fox Talbot's positive/negative calotype paper process, Regnault probably began to photograph around 1847. He photographed landscapes, architecture, portraits, and genre scenes. A founding member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 h\u00e9liographique in 1851, he also served as the founding president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Photographie in 1854. A chemist and professor of physics, he directed the S\u00e8vres Manufactory from 1852 until 1871 and established a photographic department there. He eventually gave up photography to support and promote the promising painting career of his son, Alex-Georges-Henri. His son was killed in the Franco-Prussian War, which also destroyed Regnault's laboratory at S\u00e8vres.",
