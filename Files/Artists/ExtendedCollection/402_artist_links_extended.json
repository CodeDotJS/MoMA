Shigeru was an assumed name; Tamura's personal name was probably Torashige. He studied photography at the Oriental School of Photography (\u30aa\u30ea\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u5199\u771f\u5b66\u6821, Orientaru Shashin Gakk\u014d);  graduating in 1929. With Yoshio Watanabe, in 1935 he set up a studio for advertising and other photography in Ginza, Tokyo. He was highly successful as a fashion photographer, notably in work for the magazine  Fujin Gah\u014d from 1937. Together with Ken Domon and others, he set up the Young People's Photojournalism Research Society (Seinen H\u014dd\u014dshashin Kenky\u016bkai) in 1938.\nTamura emerged from the war as a photographer of social issues in Japan, approaching them from a pacifist and left-wing angle. He also traveled, producing books on the Arab world and North Vietnam. In 1963 he set up the Japan Realist Photographers Association (Nihon Riarizumu Shashin Sh\u016bdan).\nIn the 1970s Tamura documented the topography and cultural patrimony of Japan. He died in 1987.",
