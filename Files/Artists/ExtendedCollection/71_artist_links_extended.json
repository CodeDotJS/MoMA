Since 1890, his complex painting has influenced nearly every avant-garde movement in painting, including Cubism and abstract art. In his early career, he was strongly influenced by Delacroix and Courbet, using thick slabs of paint to give his early works a sculptural presence and intensity. He exhibited with the Impressionists, but eventually rejected what he considered the Impressionists' lack of structure, declaring his intention to make Impressionism into \"something solid and durable, like the art of museums.\" Comment on works: Landscapes, Portraits",

In 1987, she became one of the first women artists to be nominated for the Turner Prize. Chadwick was known for \"challenging stereotypical perceptions of the body in elegant yet unconventional forms. Her work draws from a range of sources, from myths to science, grappling with a plethora of unconventional, visceral materials that included chocolate, lambs tongues and rotting vegetable matter. Her skilled use of traditional fabrication methods and sophisticated technologies transform these unusual materials into complex installations. Maureen Paley noted that \"Helen was always talking about craftsmanship\u2014a constant fount of information\". Binary oppositions was a strong theme in Chadwick's work; seductive/repulsive, male/female, organic/man-made. Her combinations \"emphasise yet simultaneously dissolve the contrasts between them\". Her gender representations forge a sense of ambiguity and a disquieting sexuality blurring the boundaries of ourselves as singular and stable beings.\"",

An autodidact and son of the French rural working class, he became involved in the art world when he lived next door to Otto Freundlich and Jeanne Kosnick-Kloss in Paris during the 1930s. They showed him modern art and supported his efforts to paint, helping him along and promoting his work. Gaston Chaissac is often considered to be part of the Art Brut or Outsider Art category. Some artists have described his style as \"modern rustic.\" Chaissac's art was praised by Jean Dubuffet when he first came across it in 1946.He also corresponded for some time with such prominent French artists and writers as Albert Gleizes and Raymond Queneau. Writing was an element of Gaston Chaissac's work from the beginning with his own signature. His signature evolved from being a signature to becoming an autonomous element in the composition that makes a sign, and continues with titles influenced by poetry and an exceptionally broad vocabulary.",
