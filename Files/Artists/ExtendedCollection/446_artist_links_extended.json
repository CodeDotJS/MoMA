In 1956, Wonner started painting a series of dreamlike male bathers and boys with bouquets.  In 1962, he began teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles.  By the end of the 1960s, he had abandoned his loose figurative style and focused exclusively on still lifes in a hyperrealist style.  Wonner died April 23, 2008, in San Francisco, California.",
