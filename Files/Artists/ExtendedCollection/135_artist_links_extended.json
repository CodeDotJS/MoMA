    "details": {
      "Introduction": "Llyn Foulkes (born 17 November 1934, in Yakima, Washington) is an American artist living and working in Los Angeles.\nAs a student at Chouinard Art Institute (now CalArts), Foulkes began exhibiting with the Ferus Gallery, Los Angeles in 1959. He held his first one-man exhibition at Ferus in 1961. Other early solo exhibitions included the Pasadena Art Museum (1962) and the Oakland Art Museum (1964). He also showed with a new gallery across the street from Ferus (exhibiting Jess, Georgia O'Keeffe, Irving Petlin, and others) called the Rolf Nelson Gallery (1963, 64). In 1967, Foulkes was awarded the Prize for Painting at the Paris Biennale, Musee d\u2019Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris followed by a European exhibition there. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art was the first museum to acquire his work for its collection, in 1964 as the original building was still under construction. Charles Proof Demetrion selected Foulkes to represent the United States in the IX S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial, Museu de Arte Moderna S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil also in 1967.\nThrough the late sixties into the seventies Foulkes created landscape paintings that utilized the iconography of postcards, vintage landscape photography, and Route 66-inspired hazard signs. This period resulted in his first retrospective organized by the Newport Harbor Art Museum (1974). Music also became a major catalyst in Foulkes's work at this time. He played drums with City Lights from 1965 to 1971, and formed his own band, The Rubber Band, in 1973, which stayed together until 1977. By 1979, Foulkes had returned to his childhood interest in one-man bands and began playing solo with \"The Machine,\" which he created. He still performs with The Machine regularly on the West Coast and has released a CD of original compositions, entitled Llyn Foulkes and His Machine: Live at the Church of Art.\nSince the early 1980s, Foulkes began working on a series of tableaux, beginning with O\u2019Pablo (1983). His work POP (1986-1990), in the collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, utilizes fragments of real clothing and real upholstery, all conjoined with the painted surface. Paul Shimmel included POP, along with a group of subsequent paintings, in the \"Helter Skelter\" exhibition of 1992 in which the artist was among the group exhibited. Foulkes's most recent large scale projects are The Lost Frontier (1997-2004) and Deliverance (2004-2007). The execution of these two works along with extended interviews and musical contributions by Foulkes are the subject of a documentary entitled Llyn Foulkes One Man Band, directed by Tamar Halpern and Chris Quilty. The documentary premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival in 2013, where it was called \"An illuminating portrait\" by the Hollywood Reporter, and was compared to other acclaimed artist portrait documentaries \"Searching for Sugar Man\" and \"Cutie and the Boxer\" by Variety. The film will open theatrically in the United States in May 2014.\nLlyn Foulkes was a participant and performer at dOCUMENTA (13), Kassel, Germany in 2012 and was the subject of a major retrospective which started in February 2013 at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles.\nThe documentary LLYN FOULKES ONE MAN BAND, directed by Tamar Halpern and Chris Quilty, is available on iTunes and Netflix. Llyn Foulkes played a role in the film Your Name Here, also directed by Tamar Halpern.",

In 1959, he and his wife, Claske Berndes Franck, purchased the six-acre property, the site of an old grist mill which had become a dumping ground, for $800. They opened Pacem in Terris to the public in 1966. Dr. Franck dedicated it to Dr. Albert Schweitzer, Pope John XXIII, and the Buddhist teacher D.T. Suzuki.
