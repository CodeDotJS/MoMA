In a eulogy for Schlumbohm shortly after his death in 1962, the notable design author Ralph Caplan described the typical Schlumbohm invention as \u201ca synthesis of logic and madness\u201d. Caplan, like hundreds of thousands of Americans, was particularly fond of the Chemex Coffeemaker, describing it as \u201cone of the few modern designs for which one can feel affection as well as admiration.\u201d The Chemex was also one of the few products from any designer or inventor of the time to achieve an \"iconic\" role in popular culture, becoming part of the permanent collections of art and design museums, including New York's Museum of Modern Art.",

      "Introduction": "G\u00e9rard Ernest Schneider (1896\u20131986) was a Swiss painter.\nA major pioneer of Lyrical Abstraction, a gestural and personal form of abstraction, along with Hans Hartung and Pierre Soulages, G\u00e9rard Schneider was shown in Paris at the Galerie Louis Carr\u00e9 as early as 1950.\nFrom 1955 to 1960, Schneider's work was exhibited at the Kootz Gallery in New York where an exclusivity contract connected the artist and the American dealer Samuel Kootz.\nFrom gesture, \u201cthe shape is born, whether lyrical or dramatic, with its colour and technical means, without any reference to external nature\u201d according to Schneider.\nEug\u00e8ne Ionesco spoke of \u201cthe original, eruptive, richness\u201d of his work.\nFrom nervous gesture and volcanic composition, full of tension, of the 1950s followed \u201cthe light years\u201d from Michel Ragon's expression, which were marked by the balance of forms reflecting each other and the explosion of colour. \"Painting should be looked in the same way as music is listened to\", as Schneider enjoyed saying.\nMusical, his work is to be understood like \u201can orchestra\u201d which expresses \u201cpassion, fury, romanticism\u201c according to Michel Ragon.",
