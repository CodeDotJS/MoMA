      "Introduction": "Alfred Fischer (29 August 1881 \u2013 10 April 1950) was a German architect. \nBorn in Stuttgart, Alfred Fischer studied from 1900 to 1904 at the Stuttgart Technical University of Architecture under Professor Theodor Fischer (no relation). In 1904 he deferred the 1st State examination and from 1905/1906 worked in Berlin as an assistant for the urban design consultant Ludwig Hoffmann and from 1906 to 1908 with Paul Schultze-Naumburg. In 1909 he became a teacher at the College of Arts and Crafts at the Kunstgewerbeschule D\u00fcsseldorf under Wilhelm Kreis. From 1911 to 1933 he led the Essen Arts and Crafts School (later called the Folkwangschule). In 1921 he was awarded a professorship. In 1929 he was awarded an Engineering doctorate from the Hannover Technical University.\nFischer was a member of the German Architects Federation (Bund Deutscher Architekten \u2013 BDA) and an executive member of the Deutscher Werkbund (DWB). Apart from his teaching activity he worked freelance as an architect, for some years in partnership with the architect Richard Speidel. \nAfter the change of power in 1933 to the Nazis, as an advocate of modern architecture (see Neue Sachlichkeit, modernism, Bauhaus) and modern training concepts, he experienced increasing difficulties with the school. He was given time off and soon after moved into premature retirement. Fischer left Essen and moved to Murnau. \nThe Ruhrgebiet has Alfred Fischer to thank for numerous buildings, important examples of regional architectural history and also a legacy of acknowledged contributions to industrial culture. \nThe title 'Alfred Fischer-Essen' has been given to him to distinguish him from the architect Alfred Fischer who was active at the same time in Karlsruhe. He died at Murnau am Staffelsee in 1950.",

      "Introduction": "Lothar Fischer (November 8, 1933 \u2013 June 15, 2004) was a German sculptor.\nHe was born in Germersheim, Palatinate. Between 1952 and 1958 he studied under Professor Heinrich Kirchner at the Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste, Munich. In 1958, he received a three-month scholarship to the Villa Massimo in Rome from the Arnold\u2019sche Stiftung (Arnold\u2019sche Foundation).\nAfter this he joined the painters Heimrad Prem, Helmut Sturm and Hans-Peter Zimmer in founding the group SPUR, which in 1959 entered the Situationist International. That year he participated in the Junge Kunst (Young Art) exhibition in Ulm.\nBy 1962 the SPUR group had been expelled from the Situationist International. He participated in their exhibition at the Galerie van de Loo. The next year he was involved in Visione e Colore (Visions and Colours) in the Palazzo Grassi, Venice before joining other SPUR colleagues in the Nouveaux Espaces exhibition in Paris. He then had a single exhibition at the Gallery van de Loo.\nHe was a member of the German Artists federation from 1963 to 1994. During the rest of the 1960s he continued to exhibit his work in Kassel, Amsterdam, Duisburg, Darmstadt and Wiesbaden. In 1971 he produced a sculpture for the city of Munich and another in 1972 for Darmstadt. Then in 1973 he had a solo exhibition in the Gallerie d'Arte del Naviglio, Milan.\nFrom 1975 to 1997 Fischer was professor at the University of the Arts, Berlin. He continued to exhibit mainly in Germany and Switzerland with one exhibition in New York in 1988 at the Stephen Haller Gallery. He lived and worked in Berlin and in Baierbrunn near Munich until the time of his death. Fischer was awarded the Kunstpreis Rheinland-Pfalz in 1990.",
