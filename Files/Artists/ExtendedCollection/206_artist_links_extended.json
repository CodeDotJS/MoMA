Judd's paintings focused on simplified composition while avoiding personal expression and spatial illusion. He wrote art criticisms and essays, and moved primarily to sculpture by the end of the 1970s to enhance his ideals of using real space, emphasizing geometric simplicity.",

      "Introduction": "Bishin Jumonji (\u5341\u6587\u5b57 \u7f8e\u4fe1, J\u016bmonji Bishin) is a photographer who has done advertising, portrait, architectural, and other work.\nJumonji was born in Yokohama on 4 March 1947. After studying at the Tokyo College of Photography he worked as an assistant to Kishin Shinoyama and went freelance in 1971, when he was the cameraman for advertisements for Matsushita Electric and Shiseido products.\nThe association with Matsushita would later bring awards from the Art Directors Club every year from 1975 till 1979. Jumonji has continued to do editorial and commercial work (notably for Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories); while much of this owes a lot to its art direction as well as photography, Jumonji's advertising work has been uncommonly ambitious and witty.\nIn 1972 he joined an exhibition of portraits (in Kinokuniya Gallery at Shinjuku) of Simon Yotsuya, with nine other photographers.Jumonji had started taking his \"Untitled\" series of portraits of people framed to exclude their heads in 1971. In 1972, these appeared in the magazine Camera Mainichi and were shown in the Neikrug gallery in New York; a year later they were included within \"New Japanese Photography\", at the New York MoMA.\nDown till 1980, Jumonji made nineteen trips to Hawai\u02bbi, photographing the islands  and photographing and interviewing elderly first-generation Japanese immigrants. The series counterposes color photographs of Hawai\u02bbi and black-and-white portraits of the people living there. Installments were published in Camera Mainichi in 1979 and the set was exhibited in 1980, when it won the Ina Nobuo Award. It was published, as Orchid Boat, in 1981.\nJumonji's second published collection was K\u00e9ntauros, a large-format booklet of black-and-white photographs of the members of the motorbike organization K\u00e9ntauros (then a popular brand) striking macho poses with switchblades and other fashion accessories.\nIn 1981, Jumonji went to Indochina to photograph the religious customs of the Yao people. In 1983\u20134 he visited Thailand, Burma and Laos. The result was published as Sumit\u014dtta yami in 1987.\nJumonji had started photographing gold works of art in 1981. The first exhibition of the results was in Matsuya department store (Ginza), in 1987. This work culminated in the large and lavishly produced book \u014cgon f\u016btenjin, published in 1990. This won the Domon Ken Award the following year. Some of these works would also be shown in two of a set of four volumes of stereoscopes, all photographed by Jumonji and published in 1993\u20134.\nJumonji started photographing architecture and gardens in 1988, and specifically the Katsura Detached Palace in 1991.\nJumonji photographed Matsumoto K\u014dshir\u014d IX for a collection of black-and-white portraits of the same title; in 2005 he published a second volume, Nippon Geki-gan, of monochrome portraits of actors taken with a large-format camera shortly before or after performance.\nIn 1998, Jumonji started work on Wabi, his ambitious attempt at a depiction (in color) of the Japanese aesthetic ideal of wabi. The project started with cha-no-yu but branched out into scenes of the quotidian.\nJumonji exhibited composite photographs of four Japanese waterfalls at the Shiseido Gallery (Ginza) in June and July 2004.Jumonji's photographs have appeared in Zoom and Stern.",

      "Introduction": "Dora Elisabet Jung  (16 October 1906 \u2013 19 December 1980) was textile artist, craftswoman, and industrial designer from Finland. Her career lasted five decades. She designed  products and works of art made out of linen which can be found in homes, churches, and public buildings. She was known for her expertise in designing woven damask fabrics with abstract motifs.Jung graduated in school of Art and design in 1932. She founded her own weaving atelier  where she worked for more than 50 years. She developed her own loom, but usually others did the weaving while Jung concentrated in design and improving the weaving technique.  Jung was considered by her contemporaries as the reformer of damask and her weaving as the renaissance of the damask art. Her method of damask weaving has been called the Dora Jung technique.1951 she was awarded a Grand Prix at the Milan Textile Triennial Exposition for her damask called Duvor (Doves). After that she got many contracts for public buildings. Architects and representatives of the Finnish Lutheran church appreciated her work for all of her career.  She designed for the textile factory Tampella from 1936 to 1972.  In 1957 she got the task of re-designing the damask production of Tampella. She designed several tablecloths with matching napkins and small clothes. Most of them were in white or light pastel colours, but in 1960s and 1970s even brighter colours were used.",
