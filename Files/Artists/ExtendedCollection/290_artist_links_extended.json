      "Introduction": "Murray was the principal of the Medical School at Agra, India. He photographed in Agra, Benares, Allabad, Cawnpore, Delhi, and the Northwest Provinces. He retired and returned to London in 1871. Although trained as a medical doctor, Dr. John Murray excelled as a photographer. The Scottish-born doctor was introduced to photography around 1849, while in the Medical Service of the Army of the East India Company. Stationed near the Taj Mahal in Agra, he evidently developed a considerable interest in the Mughal architecture of the region. Throughout the forty-year period that Murray lived and worked in India, he systematically recorded many famous buildings in and around Agra and the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. In the mid-1800s, no simple method of enlarging photographs existed. To make a sizable print, Murray worked with a large-format wooden camera capable of accepting negatives up to 16 by 20 inches. He worked with both glass and waxed-paper negatives; traveling photographers and those in remote places found the waxed-paper negatives particularly useful because the paper did not require immediate development. With this unwieldy equipment, Murray produced a body of work documenting India's architecture that remained unsurpassed in the 1800s. Subject of a photograph by Felice Beato.",

      "Introduction": "Eadweard Muybridge was born Edward James Muggeridge but he adopted the Saxon spelling of his name early in his life. Muybridge came to the United States in 1852 where he worked as a publisher and a book-dealer. He returned to England in 1860 and began photographing. By 1867 he returned to California and sold photographic views using the pseudonym \"Helios.\" During this time, he was commissioned by Leland Stanford to study the motion of a trotting horse using photographic methods. Muybridge abandonded the experiments in 1873 while he travelled to Central America, but began them again when he returned in 1877. His experiments with capturing motion using photography became more in-depth as he designed a faster shutter and a technique for using shorter exposures. The resulting photographs allowed him to successfully analyze each individual stage of motion of a horse trotting, and the published photographs earned him a name with the public. He also performed additional experiments using multiple cameras to capture motion, and designed a projecting device for drawings derived from his photographs called a 'zoopraxiscope'. This device allowed him to illustrate how artists in the past had inaccurately represented motion in their paintings and drawings. In 1884, Muybridge began working at the University of Pennsylvania, where he continued his experiments using multiple cameras to study human and animal motion. Many of his photographs were reproduced in his landmark publication 'Animal Locomotion'. Today Muybridge's photographic innovations are considered a precursor to modern motion pictures.
