He continued to illustrate books as he developed a separate abstract painting style that emerged out of Symbolism. Along with Robert Delaunay and Kandinsky, he developed a non-objective style preoccupied with musical rhythym and color. Kupka was interested in optics, physiology, and anthropology. Guillaume Apollinaire coined the term Orphism around 1912 in response to the work of Kupka, Francis Picabia, Robert Delaunay, and others who were developing their own response to Cubism and Futurism.",
