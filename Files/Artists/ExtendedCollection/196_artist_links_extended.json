However, the most influential locations he visited were the Dutch seaside towns of Zandvoort and Katwijk, were he adopted genre painting as a means of documenting the lives of the towns' fishermen. His painting \"Fisherman Carrying a Drowned Man\" earned him an international reputation when it was shown at the Paris Salon in 1861. After this, he continued to focus on capturing the inner lives and the grief experienced by poor fishermen and their families. Isra\u00ebls' concentration on these somber and humble themes is believed to have influenced the young Vincent van Gogh. Comment on works: history, mythology, Portraits; printmker",
