The center, which officially opened in January 2013, includes a state-of-the-art studio designed by Rybczy\u0144ski for the production of multi-layer film images, and an institute for research into images and visual technologies.\nAfter Rybczy\u0144ski discovered and published huge corruption in CeTA, they fired him and subsequently he declared the renunciation of his Polish citizenship.",
