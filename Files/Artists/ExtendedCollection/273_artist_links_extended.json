      "Introduction": "Carlo Mense (May 13, 1886 \u2013 August 11, 1965) was a German artist, associated at various times with the D\u00fcsseldorf school of painting, Rhenish Expressionism and New Objectivity.\nMense was born in Rheine. He studied with Peter Janssen at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf from 1906 to 1908, and then with Lovis Corinth at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin in 1909. In 1913, he co-organized (with August Macke) the first exhibition of the Rhenish Expressionists in Bonn. In 1914, he spent some time at the artists' colony at Ascona, where he met Georg Schrimpf and Heinrich Maria Davringhausen.From 1921 to 1925, Mense lived in Munich, where he became associated with the New Objectivity style, in particular being heavily influenced by Schrimpf, as well as by the Italian Valori Plastici group, with whom he exhibited in Florence in 1922. In 1925, he was appointed professor at the Kunstakademie Breslau. Alexander Kanoldt, also associated with New Objectivity, was appointed professor at the same time, and the two attempted to establish a center of New Objectivity there, but came into conflict with the mainly avant garde circle centered on Oskar Moll. Mense remained a professor at Breslau until 1932; soon thereafter, his works were branded degenerate art by the Nazis, and 34 works were seized and destroyed.He lived from 1945 in Bad Honnef, and died in 1965 in K\u00f6nigswinter. He was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz in 1961.",

He was part of the Mexican muralism movement in subject matter but less so in style, favoring a non-figurative and later geometric style rather than a figurative, narrative style. M\u00e9rida is best known for canvas and mural work, the latter including elements such as glass and ceramic mosaic on major constructions in the 1950s and 1960s. One of his major works 4000m2 on the Benito Juarez housing complex, was completely destroyed with the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, but a monument to it exists at another complex in the south of the city.",
