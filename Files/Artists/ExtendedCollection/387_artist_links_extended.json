      "Introduction": "Giuseppe Spagnulo (28 December 1936 \u2013 15 June 2016) was an Italian sculptor.\nSpagnulo was born in Grottaglie, Taranto. At young age he learned to work on the lathe in his father's ceramic workshop. Between 1952 and 1958 he studied at the Faenza Art Institute for Ceramics and then he moved to Milan, where he enrolled at the Brera Academy and worked as an assistant for Arnaldo Pomodoro and Lucio Fontana.In the late 1960s, Spagnulo started working on his first sculptures, including the corten steel installation \"Black Panther\" (1968-1969), which was exhibited at the 1972 Venice Biennale. In 1976 he was at the Venice Biennale again, this time with a solo presentation, and in 1977 he was invited to Documenta in Kassel.Spagnulo's sculptural style is characterized by the massive dimensions of his sculptures, often made of iron and whose subjects are generally abstract and tend to conceptualism. In the 1990s he started focusing on other materials, such as terracotta and steel. Many of his work are on display in public places in cities such as Rome, Bochum, Venice and Milan.",

Studied privately with the painter Ferdinand Engelm\u00fcller, before enrolling at the Prague Academy of Fine Arts in 1903. He left the Academy without completing his studies, later joining the M\u00e1nes Association of Plastic Artists in 1909. In 1911 he left M\u00e1nes to join the Group of Plastic Artists, but returned in 1912. He participated in the first exhibition of the Stiffnecked group in 1918, and collaborated with the Art\u011bl Cooperative in the 1920s. By 1924 all cubist elements had fallen out of his work, and he concentrated on bohemian landscapes, portraits, and by the 1930s, many floral still lifes.",

    "details": {
      "Introduction": "Sir Stanley Spencer, CBE RA (30 June 1891 \u2013 14 December 1959) was an English painter. Shortly after leaving the Slade School of Art, Spencer became well known for his paintings depicting Biblical scenes occurring as if in Cookham, the small village beside the River Thames where he was born and spent much of his life. Spencer referred to Cookham as \"a village in Heaven\" and in his biblical scenes, fellow-villagers are shown as their Gospel counterparts. Spencer was skilled at organising multi-figure compositions such as in his large paintings for the Sandham Memorial Chapel and the Shipbuilding on the Clyde series, the former being a First World War memorial while the latter was a commission for the War Artists' Advisory Committee during the Second World War.\nAs his career progressed Spencer often produced landscapes for commercial necessity and the intensity of his early visionary years diminished somewhat while elements of eccentricity came more to the fore. Although his compositions became more claustrophobic and his use of colour less vivid he maintained an attention to detail in his paintings akin to that of the Pre-Raphaelites. Spencer's works often express his fervent if unconventional Christian faith. This is especially evident in the scenes that he based in Cookham which show the compassion that he felt for his fellow residents and also his romantic and sexual obsessions. Spencer's works originally provoked great shock and controversy. Nowadays, they still seem stylistic and experimental, while the nude works depicting his futile relationship with his second wife, Patricia Preece, such as the Leg of mutton nude, foreshadow some of the much later works of Lucian Freud. Spencer's early work is regarded as a synthesis of French Post-Impressionism, exemplified for instance by Paul Gauguin, plus early Italian painting typified by Giotto. In later life Spencer remained an independent artist and did not join any of the artistic movements of the period, although he did show three works at the Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition in 1912.",

She married and collaborated with artist Leon Golub. As both artist and activist, Nancy Spero had a career that spanned fifty years. She is known for her continuous engagement with contemporary political, social, and cultural concerns. Spero chronicled wars and apocalyptic violence as well as articulating visions of ecstatic rebirth and the celebratory cycles of life. Her complex network of collective and individual voices was a catalyst for the creation of her figurative lexicon representing women from prehistory to the present in such epic-scale paintings and collage on paper as Torture of Women (1976), Notes in Time on Women (1979) and The First Language (1981). In 2010, Notes in Time was posthumously reanimated as a digital scroll in the online magazine Triple Canopy. Spero has had a number of retrospective exhibitions at major museums.",
