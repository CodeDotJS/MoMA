      "Introduction": "Philip Glass (born January 31, 1937) is an American composer and pianist. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century.  Glass's work has been associated with minimalism, being built up from repetitive phrases and shifting layers. Glass describes himself as a composer of \"music with repetitive structures\", which he has helped evolve stylistically.Glass founded the Philip Glass Ensemble, which is still in existence, but Glass no longer performs with the ensemble. He has written fifteen operas, numerous chamber operas and musical theatre works, fourteen symphonies, twelve concertos, nine string quartets and various other chamber music, and many film scores. Three of his film scores have been nominated for an Academy Award.",

He produced oil paintings, watercolor paintings, sketches, lithographs and pictures in mixed media.\nHis works from the 1920s and 1930s were characterised by his bad experiences as a soldier (1915) and his injuries (1916) during the First World War - and his belief that the growth of National Socialism was a bad thing.\nHe took part in the Hannoversche Sezession from 1918, where he met Kurt Schwitters, among others, and became friends with Theodor D\u00e4ubler. His exhibition was banned, and he was named a degenerate artist in 1938.",

Godwin's influence can be detected in the later Arts and Crafts movement.\nHis best known early works include The Guild Hall, Northampton, which was his first notable public commission, and Congleton Town Hall, as well as restorations and neo-Gothic additions to Dromore Castle, Limerick and Castle Ashby.",
