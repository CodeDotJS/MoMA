      "Introduction": "Roland David Smith (March 9, 1906 \u2013 May 23, 1965) was an influential and innovative American abstract expressionist sculptor and painter, best known for creating large steel abstract geometric sculptures. Born in Decatur, Indiana, Smith initially pursued painting, receiving training at the Art Students League in New York from 1926 to 1930. However, his artistic journey took a transformative turn in the early 1930s when he shifted his focus to sculpture.\nIn the early phase of his career, he crafted welded metal constructions that incorporated industrial objects, foreshadowing later developments in sculpture. \nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, his work shifted to more personal, landscape-inspired sculptures. These works possessed a delicate linear quality, akin to drawing in metal, and echoed the aesthetics of contemporary painting. Notably, Smith cultivated strong friendships with renowned Abstract Expressionist painters, including Jackson Pollock and Robert Motherwell, illustrating the interplay between different art forms during this period.\nBy the late 1950s, his sculptures started to assume monumental proportions. Using overlapping geometric plates of highly polished steel, his works developed a reductive and geometric aesthetic. These massive pieces of the 1960s are considered precursors to the minimal \"primary structures\" that emerged later in the decade, further exemplifying Smith's forward-thinking approach to sculpture.",

Some publishers include The Museum of Modern Art, Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Edizioni di Comunit\u00e0 and Penguin Books.\nAbove all, Kidder Smith was an astute observer - in words and pictures - of modern architecture and the historic built environment of numerous cities and countries across the globe. During the 1950s and 1960s, thanks to his activism as a preservationist, he rallied a number of high-profile individuals and eventually helped prevent the Robie House and Villa Savoye from being demolished. In his New York Times obit published on October 26, 1997, Herbert Muschamp described G. E. Kidder Smith as a \u201ccivic watchdog.\u201d",
