In 1976 took place her first solo exhibition in the gallery of the London Polytechnic.Her work has been widely collected by major museums; in 2007, she was named a Chevalier of Arts and Letters in France.\nShe was selected as one of 213 artists for the 59th Venice Biennale in 2022.",

He soon met future Impressionists Camille Pissarro and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Renoir and Monet began painting outdoors together in the late 1860s, laying the foundations of Impressionism. In 1874, with Pissarro and Edgar Degas, Monet helped organize the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Artistes, Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs, etc., the formal name of the Impressionists' group. During the 1870s Monet developed his charateristic technique for rendering atmospheric outdoor light, using broken, rhythmic brushwork. Throughout his career, he remained loyal to the Impressionists' early goal of capturing the transitory effects of nature through direct observation. In 1890 he began creating paintings in series, depicting the same subject under various conditions and at different times of the day. His late pictures, made when he was half-blind, are shimmering pools of color almost totally devoid of form.",
