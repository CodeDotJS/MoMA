      "Introduction": "Nicolas Sch\u00f6ffer (Hungarian: Sch\u00f6ffer Mikl\u00f3s; 6 September 1912 \u2014 8 January 1992) was a Hungarian-born French cybernetic artist. Sch\u00f6ffer was born in Kalocsa, Hungary and resided in Paris from 1936 until his death in Montmartre in 1992.\nHe built his artworks on cybernetic theories of contol and feedback primarily based on the ideas of Norbert Wiener. Wiener's work suggested to Sch\u00f6ffer an artistic process in terms of the circular causality of feedback loops that he used on a wide range of art genres. His career spans painting, sculpture, architecture, urbanism, film, theatre, television and music. The quest for dematerialisation of the artwork and the pursuit of movement and dynamics became the central themes of his work. He worked with the immaterial media space, time, light, sound and climate that he called the five topologies.\nHe liberated art genres from their spatial and temporal constraints by creating never-ending sound structures that can be heard all over the cybernetic city of the future and by designing SCAM1, an automobile sculpture.\nSch\u00f6ffer declared the socialization of art as an important goal. According to his ideas, art as a cultural asset should be available equally to everyone without any limitation. The playful and spectacular aspects of his works served the goal of gaining the attention of the audience and involving the viewer through participation in the creative processes. In order to make art universally available, he explored the possibilities of serial production.",

      "Introduction": "Georg Scholz (October 10, 1890\u00a0\u2013 November 27, 1945) was a German painter, member of the New Objectivity movement.\nScholz was born in Wolfenb\u00fcttel and had his artistic training at the Karlsruhe Academy, where his teachers included Hans Thoma and Wilhelm Tr\u00fcbner. He later studied in Berlin under Lovis Corinth. After military service in World War I lasting from 1915 to 1918, he resumed painting, working in a style fusing cubist and futurist ideas.\nIn 1919 Scholz became a member of the Communist Party of Germany, and his work of the next few years is harshly critical of the social and economic order in postwar Germany. His Industrial Farmers of 1920 is an oil painting with collage that depicts a Bible-clutching farmer with money erupting from his forehead, seated next to his monstrous wife who cradles a piglet. Their subhuman son, his head open at the top to show that it is empty, is torturing a frog. Perhaps Scholz' best-known work, it is typical of the paintings he produced in the early 1920s, combining a controlled, crisp execution with corrosive sarcasm.\nScholz quickly became one of the leaders of the New Objectivity, a group of artists who practiced a cynical form of realism. The most famous among this group are Max Beckmann, George Grosz and Otto Dix, and Scholz's work briefly vied with theirs for ferocity of attack. By 1925, however, his approach had softened into something closer to neoclassicism, as seen in  the Self-Portrait in front of an Advertising Column of 1926 and the Seated Nude with Plaster Bust of 1927.\nIn 1925, he was appointed a professor at the Baden State Academy of Art in Karlsruhe, where his students included Rudolf Dischinger. Scholz began contributing in 1926 to the satirical magazine Simplicissimus, and in 1928 he visited Paris  where he especially appreciated the work of Bonnard.\nWith the rise to power of Hitler and the National Socialists in 1933, Scholz was quickly dismissed from his teaching position. Declared a Degenerate Artist, his works were among those seized in 1937 as part of a campaign by the Nazis to \"purify\" German culture, and he was forbidden to paint in 1939.\nIn 1945, the French occupation forces appointed Scholz mayor of Waldkirch, but he died that same year, in Waldkirch.",
