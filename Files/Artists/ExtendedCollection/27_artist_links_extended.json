Her early work emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s, \"inverting the notion of background and foreground\" in photography and bringing awareness to a viewer's attention to visual information with in the photographic frame. Her work is as much about vision and perception as it is about the failure to see, the faith humans place in the mechanics of perception, and the precarious nature of perceptual habits. Barth's says this about her art practice: \u201cThe question for me always is how can I make you aware of your own looking, instead of losing your attention to thoughts about what it is that you are looking at.\" She has been honored with two National Endowments of the Arts fellowships, was a recipient of the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship in 2004\u201105, and was a 2012 MacArthur Fellow. Barth lives and works in Los Angeles, California.",
