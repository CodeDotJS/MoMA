      "Introduction": "Edward Maurice FitzGerald \"Robyn\" Denny (3 October 1930 \u2013 20 May 2014) was one of a group of young artists who transformed British art in the late 1950s, leading it into the international mainstream. Reacting against the mainstream St Ives School of landscape-based painting and inspired by Abstract Expressionism, American films, popular culture and urban modernity, they saw abstract painting as their only conceivable route.",

      "Introduction": "Depero worked in multiple media, hoping to unite artistic modes using materials of every kind, extending to theatrical productions. Through Marinetti he officially joined the Futurists ca.1914, but is not considered a founding member. With Balla he wrote the 'manifesto Ricostruzione futurista dell\u2019universo' in 1915. He was also active as a poet. In 1917, he was invited to Capri by Gilbert Clavel (1883\u20131927) to illustrate his book 'Un istituto per suicidi,' and worked with Clavel on the his Teatro Plastico, a theatrical production without actors, which was performed in the Balli plastici, staged in 1918 at the Teatro dei Piccoli in Rome. He lived in New York City twice, first in the late 1920s, and again in the late 1940s, where he did work as a graphic designer for popular magazines and as an interior designer, which he continued to do in Italy. In the 1930s he was active as an art critic.",

April 29]\u00a01917 \u2013 October 13, 1961) was a Ukrainian-born (then part of the Russian Empire, now independent Ukraine) American experimental filmmaker and important part of the avant-garde in the 1940s and 1950s. Deren was also a choreographer, dancer, film theorist, poet, lecturer, writer, and photographer.\nThe function of film, Deren believed, was to create an experience. She combined her expertise in dance and choreography, ethnography, the African spirit religion of Haitian Vodou,  symbolist poetry and gestalt psychology (student of Kurt Koffka)  in a series of perceptual, black-and-white short films. Using editing, multiple exposures, jump-cutting, superimposition, slow-motion, and other camera techniques to her advantage, Deren abandoned established notions of physical space and time, innovating through carefully planned films with specific conceptual aims.Meshes of the Afternoon (1943), her collaboration with her husband at the time Alexander Hammid, has been one of the most influential experimental films in American cinema history. Deren went on to make several more films, including but not limited to At Land (1944), A Study in Choreography for Camera (1945), and Ritual in Transfigured Time (1946), writing, producing, directing, editing, and photographing them with help from only one other person, Hella Heyman, her camerawoman.",

DeSana's photography has been described as \"anti-art\" in its approach to capturing images of the human body, in a manner ranging from \"savagely explicit to purely symbolic\". DeSana was close collaborators with photographer Laurie Simmons and writer William S. Burroughs, who wrote the introduction to DeSana's self-published collection of photographs Submission. His work includes the album cover for the Talking Heads album More Songs about Buildings and Food as well as John Giorno\u2019s LP, You\u2019re The Guy I Want To Share My Money With.",
