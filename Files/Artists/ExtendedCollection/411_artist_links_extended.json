      "Introduction": "Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda (28 July 1874\u00a0\u2013 8 August 1949) was a Uruguayan-Spanish artist, sculptor, muralist, novelist, writer, teacher, and theorist born in Montevideo, Uruguay. As an adolescent emigrated to Catalunya, Spain, where he began his career as an artist. He lived and worked primarily in Spain, and was also active in the United States, Italy, France, and Uruguay. Torres-Garc\u00eda is known for creating the prominent art movements Modern Classicism and Universal Constructivism.\n\nTorres-Garc\u00eda collaborated as a young man with Antoni Gaud\u00ed on the stained-glass windows for the Palma Cathedral and the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. He decorated the medieval Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya with monumental frescoes in the Modern Classic style. Torres-Garc\u00eda in later years developed a unique style known as Universal Constructive Art during the 1930's in Paris.\nTorres-Garc\u00eda published over 150 books, essays and articles in Catalan, Spanish, French and English, and gave more than 500 lectures. He founded art schools in Spain and Montevideo and a number of artistic groups, including the first European abstract-art group Cercle et Carr\u00e9 (Circle and Square) in Paris in 1929.\nFirst posthumous retrospectives in Paris (1955) and Amsterdam (1961) are the earliest shows documenting Torres-Garc\u00eda importance in the world of abstract art.The Museum of Modern Art opened its Latin American collection with an acquisition of Torres-Garc\u00eda's painting. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum had a retrospective exhibition in the 1971, and more-recent retrospectives in New York 2015 and 2018.",
