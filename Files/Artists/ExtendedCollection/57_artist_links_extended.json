    "details": {
      "Introduction": "G\u00fcnter Brus (born 27 September 1938, Ardning, Styria, Austria) is an Austrian painter, performance artist, graphic artist, experimental filmmaker and writer.\nBrus grew up in Mureck, attended the Kunstgewerbeschule Graz and went to Vienna in 1956, where he studied painting and met his lifelong friend Alfons Schilling. \nInfluenced by German expressionism, Edvard Munch, Vincent van Gogh, abstract expressionism and artists such as Emilio Vedova, he began in the fall of 1960 to create artwork that was not confined to visual media.\nHis companion Otto Muehl, who met him at the time, said of his work: \u201cThe color sometimes exploded like a bomb when it hit the picture. That was total creative excess. [...] The entire room was covered with paint splatters, and the dried paint sludge lay inches high on the floor.\u201d\nShortly before his first major exhibition together with Schilling, he was conscripted into the military in May 1961. After completing his military service, he fell into a psychological crisis and did not start work again until the end of 1962. In 1964, Brus performed his first \"Aktion\" titled Ana, in which he painted his wife Anni Brus, his own body, and the surroundings of his studio with white and black paint. Throughout the latter half of the 1960s he staged numerous performances with his own body at the center of the action, as in the actions Selbstbemalung and Selbstverst\u00fcmmelung.\nHe was a co-founder in 1964 of Viennese Actionism (German: Wiener Aktionismus with Otto Muehl, Hermann Nitsch, and Rudolf Schwarzkogler. His aggressively presented actionism intentionally disregarded conventions and taboos, with the intent of shocking the viewer. At the Kunst und Revolution event at the University of Vienna in 1968, Brus urinated into a glass then proceeded to cover his body in his own excrement, and  During the performance Brus also sang the Austrian National Anthem while masturbating. Brus ended the piece by drinking his own urine and inducing vomiting, and was subsequently arrested. Through this piece and his other performance works, Brus hoped to reveal the still fascist essence of the nation. This performance created a public outrage at the time and the participants were dubbed by the media as uniferkel or \"University Piggies.\" Sentenced to 6 months in prison after the event and subsequent public reactions, he fled to Berlin with his family and returned to Austria in 1976. Brus also was editor of the Die Schastrommel (author's edition) from 1969 on. He was involved in the NO!Art movement.\nIn 1966 he participated in the Destruction in Art Symposium (DIAS) in London with fellow artists Gustav Metzger, Otto Muehl, Wolf Vostell, Yoko Ono, and others .G\u00fcnter Brus participated in Documenta 5 in Kassel in 1972 and was represented as an artist at Documenta 6 (1977) and Documenta 7 in 1982. From 1970 he began on his novel Irrwisch, which was underpinned by numerous drawings. Works emerged that he calls picture poems which opened a new section in Brus's work, the fruit of which is the rich graphic and literary work of the 1970s and 1980s.\nBrus was awarded the Grand Austrian State Prize in 1996. Most of his works are shocking and controversial. The Joanneum now houses a permanent gallery, called the Bruseum, featuring the work of Brus and fellow Viennese Actionists.\nBrus has been a columnist and illustrator for the Austrian monthly magazine Datum since summer 2005. He lives and works in Graz and on the Canary Islands.\nKurt Flecker, then cultural advisor for Styria, laid the foundation stone for his own Brus Museum in 2008 with a collection purchase for the Neue Galerie Graz. The \"BRUSEUM\", which opened on November 26, 2011 at the new location of the Neue Galerie Graz in the Joanneumsviertel, is designed as a permanent high-profile exhibition space. It is dedicated to the preservation of central works of the artist.\nIn 2010, Berlin-based art film home video company Edition Kr\u00f6thenhayn released a boxset including a DVD containing his films (including, inter alia, 8/64: Ana \u2013 Aktion Brus, 10c/65: Brus w\u00fcnscht euch seine Weihnachten, 10b/65: Silber \u2013 Aktion Brus, 10/65: Selbstverst\u00fcmmelung, 16/67: 20. September, Die Blumen des B\u00f6sen, Strangulation, Psycho-Dramolett, Kunst und Revolution, Osmose, Einatmen \u2013 Ausatmen, Handlung, Zerrei\u00dfprobe, Selbstbemalung, and Wiener Spaziergang), directed by, among others, Kurt Kren, Hans Christof Stenzel, Peter Gorsen, Ernst Schmidt Jr., Helmut Kronberger, Werner Schulz, Otto Muehl, as well as by Brus himself and his wife Anni Brus, compiled and presented in a documentary format by Peter Kasperak, with a total running length of 82 minutes in a limited edition of a thousand hand-numbered copies under the title K\u00f6rperanalysen: Aktionen 1964\u20131970. The DVD further features a 2004 52-minutes television documentary film about Brus called Schrecklich verletzlich \u2013 G\u00fcnter Brus directed by Peter Kasperak, Anita Natmessnig, and Adam Wallisch as well as many slide shows of Actionism photography by Ludwig Hoffenreich and others. The boxset also sports a 100-pages book with photos and texts by Peter Weibel and Theo Altenberg.His wife Ana played an essential role in Brus' work. In a newspaper interview in 2018, she said that she took part in Rudolf Schwarzkogler's \"Wedding\" campaign because Schwarzkogler's wife would never have been willing to show her breasts and Schwarzkogler was too shy to ask a woman. In addition, she once obtained 40 condoms from a pharmacy for an action from Hermann Nitsch because Nitsch did not dare to buy them himself.",

Although he was not officially part of the Bauhaus movement, Buchheister was a close friend of Wassily Kandinsky and paralleled many of the social and artistic goals of the Bauhaus school. With regard to constructivism, Buchheister was typically more playful and improvisational than his contemporaries, becoming interested in the Dada movement after a collaboration with Kurt Schwitters in the late 1920s which led him to incorporate more varied materials such as acrylic glass, aluminum, wood, and twine into his compositions. This direction was given much freer rein after World War II and the end of Nazism. He died in Hanover in 1964.",
