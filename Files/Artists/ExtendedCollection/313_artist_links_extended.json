      "Introduction": "George Roy Partridge (October 14, 1888 \u2013 January 25, 1984), also known professionally as Roi Partridge, was an American printmaker and teacher. He was born in Centralia, Washington. At age four he moved with his family to Seattle, where his father worked as a typesetter and later owned the local newspaper.\nIn Seattle, Partridge was one of three Seattle artists who worked together under the name \"The Triad\". The others were painter John Butler and miniaturist Clare Shepard Shisler. Also in their circle were photographer\u2014and Partridge's future wife\u2014Imogen Cunningham, and painters Mabel Lisle Ducasse and Yasushi Tanaka.In 1909 the budding artist traveled with Butler to New York City for one year of art study at the National Academy of Design and then studied etching in Munich. His next three years were spent in Paris where he worked as a printmaker under the mentorship of Bertha Jaques.  When the German troops were approaching the French capital in 1914, Roi returned to Seattle.  When 44 of his etchings were shown at the Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition in 1915, he decided to make California his home.  After moving to San Francisco in 1917, he began teaching at Mills College in Oakland, California in 1920 and became the first director of the school's art gallery.  His marriage to photographer Imogen Cunningham in 1915 ended in divorce in 1934. They had three sons, including photographer Rondal Partridge. His second wife, artist Marion Lyman, died of cancer in 1940; his third wife was May Fisher.Partridge took a leave of absence from Mills College in 1946, continued etching until 1952, and retired in 1954.  His last years were spent in Rossmoor in Walnut Creek, California, where he died on January 25, 1984.",
