He was trained as a bookbinder, and took up photography as an amateur. As a conscript in WWI he was wounded and lost his hand. He later studied with Karel Nov\u00e1k at the State School of Graphic Art 1922 to 1924. From 1928 until his death he worked in the same wooden studio building in Prague, itself becoming a subject of many of his photographs. Early in his career he did advertising work, portraiture, and landscapes. From 1940 he stopped making enlargements and made only contact prints from large negatives. He lived in seclusion from the beginning of World War II, and concentrated on still lifes. He received the Czech government artists of merit award in 1961.",

Driven by an interest in avant-garde painting, Sugai moved to Paris in 1952 where he quickly attracted critical attention, participating in numerous exhibitions in Paris and abroad. First working in a style resembling informalism or lyrical abstraction, he became affiliated with the Nouvelle \u00c9cole de Paris. During the early 1960s, his artworks radically transformed when he developed a hard-edge abstract style influenced by his interest in automobiles and contemporary urban living. While he did not officially associate himself with any single artistic movement or group, he collaborated on multiple projects with his poet friends, Jean-Clarence Lambert and Makota \u014coka.",
