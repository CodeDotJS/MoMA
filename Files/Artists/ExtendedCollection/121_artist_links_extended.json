Ernst's Surrealist paintings are steeped in Freudian metaphor, private mythology, and childhood memories.

He embraced the use of collage, frottage, and decalcomania in his diverse works, and published a series of purely pictorial novels created from collaged found images.",

The paintings generally consist of reflective, clean, and inanimate city and geometric landscapes. He is regarded as one of the founders of the international photo-realist movement of the late 1960s, with such painters as John Baeder, Chuck Close, Robert Cottingham, Audrey Flack, Ralph Goings, and Duane Hanson.  Author Graham Thompson writes \"One demonstration of the way photography became assimilated into the art world is the success of photorealist painting in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  It is also called super-realism or hyper-realism and painters like Richard Estes, Denis Peterson, Audrey Flack, and Chuck Close often worked from photographic stills to create paintings that appeared to be photographs.\"",
