It derived from his maternal grandfather's name, \"Lecorb\u00e9sier.\" He emigrated to France in 1917 and was naturalized in 1930. Born into a family of horologists and enamelers, he studied at \u00c9cole d'Art in Chaux-de-Fonds, but was largely self-taught in painting and architecture through study trips. In the 1920s he emerged as the most important architect of the \"International Style\" in France. He established the Fondation Le Corbusier in Paris to care for and make available to scholars his library, architectural drawings, sketches, and paintings.",
