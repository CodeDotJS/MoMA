      "Introduction": "Raymond Savignac, often just abbreviated to \"Savignac\", was a French graphic artist famous for his commercial posters. He was born on November 6, 1907 in Paris, and died on October 30, 2002 in Trouville-sur-Mer (Calvados), aged 94. His work is distinguished by a humorous simplicity.Self-taught, he started designing posters under the direction of Cassandre, but met his greatest success with the poster for Yoplait yogurt, which featured the udders of a cow directly supplying the \"milk yogurt\" with milk.\nAnother famous poster was called \"La Guerre des boutons\" (War of Buttons).\nIn 1949, Savignac's works were exhibited with those of his contemporary poster artist Bernard Villemot at the Gallery of Beaux Arts in Paris. A permanent display of his work may be found at the Montebello Museum in Trouville, where he spent his last years. There is also a beachfront walk dedicated to him. Many of his posters depicted the Norman seaside town. These works can be seen there. His murals can be seen also around town.",
