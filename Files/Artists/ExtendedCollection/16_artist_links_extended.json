      "Introduction": "Eduardo Arroyo Rodr\u00edguez (26 February 1937 \u2013 14 October 2018) was a Spanish painter and graphic artist. He was also active as an author and set designer. Arroyo is regarded as one of the most important exponents of politically committed realism.Arroyo was born in Madrid and originally trained a journalist, graduating from School of Journalism, Madrid in 1958. Following his studies and growing contempt for the Francoist Spain, Arroyo emigrated to Paris at the age of 21. He originally began working as an author and journalist, but soon decided to devote himself to painting.\nIn Paris, he befriended members of the young art scene, especially Gilles Aillaud, with whom he later collaborated in creating stage sets, such as Vivre et laisser mourir ou la fin tragique de Marcel Duchamp, a work in eight pieces intended to criticize contemporary French art. He also befriended Joan Mir\u00f3. In 1964, he made his breakthrough with his first important exhibition. He dominated the major post-Franco exhibition of Spanish art at the Venice Biennale of 1976. Over 20 years of critical and commercial success followed. In his old age, the ideologically and creatively uncompromising artist was as active as ever.\nStylistically, Arroyo's mostly ironic, colorful works are at the crossroads between the trends of nouvelle figuration or figuration narrative and pop art. A characteristic of his representations is the general absence of spatial depth and the flattening of perspective.\nArroyo also became known to a broad public through his many works as a set designer, as well as partially by his costume designs. In this relation, he cooperated since 1969 especially with the director Klaus Michael Gr\u00fcber, who encouraged him in this activity. Arroyo created sets for, among others, the Piccolo Teatro in Milan, the Paris Op\u00e9ra (in 1976, Richard Wagner's Die Walk\u00fcre), the Schaub\u00fchne am Lehniner Platz in Berlin and the Salzburger Festspiele (in 1991, Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek's Z mrtveho domu).\nIn 1982 he received Spain's National Award for Plastic Arts.Arroyo's stage play, Bantam, premiered at the Bayerisches Staatsschauspiel (Residenztheater) in Munich with great success in 1986, with his friend, Gr\u00fcber, as director and Ailland and Antonio Recalcati for sets and costumes.\nExhibiting since 1961, Arroyo's work has been shown in exhibitions across the globe, including the Neue Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Bildende Kunst, Berlin (1971); the Centre Pompidou, Paris (1982); Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, NY (1984); Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte, Dortmund, (1987); Institut Valenci\u00e0 d'Art Modern, Valencia (1989); Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, Madrid (1998), and most recently held a solo exhibition at Fundaci\u00f3n ENAIRE in Santander, Spain (2021\u201322). Arroyo's paintings are showcased at the Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo in Madrid. His most renowned work, Vestido bajando la escalera, belongs to the collection of the Institut Valenci\u00e0 d'Art Modern, in Val\u00e8ncia.",

He is widely considered an important figure in the development of the theatrical avant-garde during the latter half of the 20th century. He began writing art criticism from ca.1920, and in Paris studied acting with Charles Dullin around this time. He created drawings, which he continued to do, with gaps, for the remainder of his life. He founded the Alfred Jarry Theatre and the Th\u00e9atre de l'Atelier, for which he designed sets. He was prolific in the last years of his life, writing essays, drawing, and producing a radio play 'Pour en Finir avec le Jugement de dieu.'",
