Upon his return to New York, Stankiewicz joined the cooperative Hansa Gallery; he exhibited there until the end of the 1950s, moving to the Stable Gallery in 1959.  In 1962 he left the city for Huntington, Massachusetts.  Stankiewicz continued to exhibit internationally until his death in 1983.  Today his work may be seen in numerous museum collections, including those of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and the Walker Art Center.",
