He worked principally as a painter, sculptor, and engraver, also taught, and was involved in the foundation of a number of institutions of culture and education. He is perhaps best known for his mural painting, typically imbued with \"fervent social criticism\". He is acclaimed as the first artist to borrow the traditional material of coloured cement as the medium for a \"modern work of art\". Publicity-shy, he is said to have turned down Mexico's Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes before finally accepting it in 2001. Before his death, Sotheby's described him as \"the most important living Mexican artist up to date\".",
