      "Introduction": "Born into a family of printers, Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Tournachon began his career as a journalist, and later a caricaturist. He began to use the name \"Nadar\" in 1839 in his articles written for Parisian journals. He first attempted photography in 1853, and in 1854 he studied photography with Camille d'Arnaud. He opened his own studio in Paris and became known as a respected portrait photographer, with a concern for grasping the sitter's \"inner life\". In 1857, Nadar began to experiment with electric lighting and then opened the Salon of Electric Photography in Paris. In 1858, Nadar took the first aerial photographs of Paris from a hot air balloon. Two years later, he established branch studios in Paris and Marseille, and was named Inspector General of Photographers of the French Army in 1861. From 1861 to 1862, Nadar made photographic reportages on the sewers and catacombs of Paris. In 1870, Nadar organized a carrier-pigeon and micro photography system to deliver messages out of the beseiged city of Paris. Nadar's son Paul became director of the photography business in 1874 and became head of the firm in 1886 upon the retirement of his father. A fourth Nadar studio was opened in Marseille in 1896.",

      "Introduction": "Masayuki Nagare (\u6d41 \u653f\u4e4b, Nagare Masayuki, February 14, 1923 \u2013 July 7, 2018) was a modernist Japanese sculptor, nicknamed \"Samurai Artist\" for his commitment to traditional Japanese aesthetics.  He was born in 1923 in Nagasaki to Kojuro Nakagawa, the founder and president of Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto.  As a teenager, he received training in the martial arts of a samurai, particularly swordsmanship, and lived in several temples in Kyoto, where he observed the patterns of rocks, plants, and water created by traditional landscape artists.In 1942, he enrolled at Ritsumeikan University, where he studied Shinto and was apprenticed to a master swordsmith.  He left university in 1943 to join the Imperial Japanese Navy and did not return to complete his studies.  Nagare served as a Zero Fighter pilot in the Pacific War.  After the War, he traveled all over Honshu Island until the mid-1950s, witnessing the desolation of the ruined countryside, developing a thorough understanding of the Japanese landscape, and becoming interested in local crafts such as pottery.  His fascination with graveyard tombstones that had survived wartime bombing led to his longtime choice of stone as his preferred medium.Nagare's art is strongly influenced by Shinto, Zen Buddhism, and traditional Japanese martial arts.  His principal stone-carving techniques include warehada (\"cracked skin\" or \"broken texture\"), in which the surface is left rough, with visible chisel marks, and shinogi awase (\"ridges joined together\"), which describes the meeting of two highly polished surfaces.  Some of his works exhibit the contrast between the two techniques.  His sculptures' clean lines often follow the subtle curvature of Japanese swords.Nagare's works include Cloud Fortress, which survived the 9/11 attacks at the World Trade Center (New York City) but was destroyed in the rescue and recovery efforts, Sakimori (Frontier Guardian) installed in the Honolulu Museum of Art, Hamaritsurin Garden in Seto Ohashi Commemorative Park (Kagawa Prefecture, Japan), Receiving (\u53d7 Ju) stored at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City,  and Transcendence (informally called The Banker's Heart by locals) installed in A.P. Giannini Plaza at 555 California Street (formerly the Bank of America building) in San Francisco, California. He died in July 2018 at the age of 95.",

His photographs of conceptual artist Yutaka Matsuzawa are a key resource for understanding Matsuzawa\u2019s practice. Video Earth, the collective Nakajima founded with his students at Tokyo College of Photography, is one of the earliest video collectives in Japan, roughly contemporaneous with Video Hiroba. Nakajima was also a prolific experimenter and inventor, working with Sony and JVC to create the Animaker and the Aniputer, respectively. Since the late 1960s he has participated in numerous international film and video festivals, and supported the work of younger generations of artists as a mentor.",
