During his extended art career (1954-2013),  his artworks often protested the Argentine government, the imperialist west, and the Church. \nFerrari's protest piece \"Western and Christian Civilization\", which depicted a near life-size Christ hanging crucified on an American fighter jet, attracted controversy when he created it in 1965, and it has been exhibited many times since. Ferrari caused protests against his work throughout his career, including from Pope Francis when he was still Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio.",

This group of artists, known as the \u201cMoritzboys\u201d and including, among others, Salom\u00e9, Bernd Zimmer, and Helmut Middendorf, subsequently achieved international acclaim as the \u201cJunge Wilde\u201d or \u201cNeue Wilde\u201d in the early 1980s. Fetting is now one of the internationally best known contemporary German artists, having created a large oeuvre of expressive figurative paintings covering many different kinds of subject-matter, as well as many bronze sculptures.",
