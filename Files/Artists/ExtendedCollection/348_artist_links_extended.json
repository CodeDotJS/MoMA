      "Introduction": "Ugo Rondinone (born November 30, 1964) is a Swiss-born artist widely recognized for his mastery of several different media\u2014most prominently sculpture, drawing and painting, but also photography, architecture, video and sound installation\u2014in the largely figurative works he has made for exhibitions in galleries, museums and outdoor public spaces around the world. He has never limited himself to a particular material, no more than he has to a single discipline. Lead, wood, wax, bronze, stained glass, ink, paint, soil and stone are all tools in a creative arsenal that the artist has employed to extend the Romantic tradition in works that are as sensitive to the passage of time as to the nuances of body language and the spoken word.\nRondinone is widely known for his temporary, large-scale land art sculpture, Seven Magic Mountains (2016\u20132021), with its seven fluorescently-painted totems of large, car-size stones stacked 32 feet (9.8\u00a0m) high.",
