Gudiashvili was born into a family of a railroad employee. He studied in the Tbilisi school of sculpture and fine art (1910\u20131914), where he met the Armenian artist Alexander Bazhbeuk-Melikyan, and later in Ronson's private academy in Paris (1919\u20131926). For a while, Gudiashvili belonged to a group of Georgian poets called \"The Blue Horns\" (1914\u20131918), who were trying to connect organically the Georgian national flavour with the creative structure of French symbolism. In Paris, he was a constant customer of the famous \"La Ruche,\" a colony of painters where he met Ignacio Zuloaga, Amedeo Modigliani, Natalia Goncharova, and Mikhail Larionov. Gudiashvili's work was greatly influenced by Niko Pirosmani.\nFilled with the charm of Georgian life, the painter's early works combine dramatic grotesque with the charm of poetic mystery (Live Fish, 1920, Art Museum of Georgia). Closeness to the traditions of old Caucasian and Persian art was amplified upon his return to Georgia in 1926. Gudiashvili's colours become warmer, and the perception of the world as a theater grew stronger (many of Gudiashvili's paintings were either inspired by operas and balles or serve to depict actresses in costumes). Like his compatriots (Grigol Robakidze, Konstantine Gamsakhurdia), Gudiashvili freely used mythological allegories (The Walk of Seraphita, 1940), the center of which was a graciously beautiful woman imagined as the mysterious \"Goddess of the Earth.\"\nGudiashvili also worked as a monumentalist, painting anew the Kashveti Church in Tbilisi in 1946, for which he was expelled from the Communist Party and fired from the Tbilisi academy of fine arts, where he had been teaching since 1926.\nIn the voluminous \"antifascist cycle\" of Indian ink drawings Gudiashvili became a kind of \"Georgian Goya\": beast-like monsters surrounded the ruins of art and naked \"goddesses\" conveyed the ideas of the death of culture.\nGudiashvili worked also as a book illustrator, set and theater decorator. He died on 20 July 1980 in Tbilisi.",

Noted for her distinct three-octave vocal range and eccentric persona, she has developed an eclectic musical style over her four-decade career that has drawn on electronic, pop, experimental, trip hop, classical, and avant-garde music.\nBorn and raised in Reykjav\u00edk, Bj\u00f6rk began her music career at the age of 11 and gained international recognition as the lead singer of the alternative rock band the Sugarcubes by the age of 21. After the Sugarcubes disbanded in 1992, Bj\u00f6rk began a solo career. She came to prominence with albums such as Debut (1993), Post (1995), and Homogenic (1997), collaborating with a range of artists and exploring a variety of multimedia projects. Her other albums include Vespertine (2001), Med\u00falla (2004), Volta (2007), Biophilia (2011), Vulnicura (2015), Utopia (2017) and Fossora (2022).\nSeveral of Bj\u00f6rk's albums have reached the top 20 on the US Billboard 200 chart. As of 2015, she had sold more than 20 million records worldwide. Thirty-one of her singles have reached the top 40 on pop charts around the world, with 22 top 40 hits in the UK, including the top-10 singles \"It's Oh So Quiet\", \"Army of Me\", and \"Hyperballad\" and the top-20 singles \"Play Dead\", \"Big Time Sensuality\", and \"Violently Happy\". Her accolades and awards include the Order of the Falcon, five BRIT Awards, and 16 Grammy nominations. In 2015, Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Rolling Stone named her the 60th greatest singer and the 81st greatest songwriter.\nBj\u00f6rk starred in the 2000 Lars von Trier film Dancer in the Dark, for which she won the Best Actress Award at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"I've Seen It All\". Biophilia was marketed as an interactive app album with its own education program. Bj\u00f6rk has also been an advocate for environmental causes in Iceland. A retrospective exhibition dedicated to Bj\u00f6rk was held at the New York Museum of Modern Art in 2015.",
