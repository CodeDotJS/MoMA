      "Introduction": "Hopper was one of the premier Realist painters of the 1930s and 1940s. In 1900, Hopper studied portrait and still-life painting with William Merritt Chase, but he preferred to take classes with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Robert Henri. In 1906, Hopper worked as a part-time illustrator, but by autumn of that year he went to Paris to study the work of European artists. His painting from this period and soon after reflects the influence of \"plein air\" painting and Impressionism. Hopper continued to work as an illustrator, garnering more critical and commercial success with it than painting, although he loathed this work. By 1925, Hopper began to develop his signature, where the focus is on only one or two solitary figures often consumed by vast outdoors spaces or cramped city streets. His landscapes also evoke a similar haunting loneliness. One of Hopper's most well known works is a poignant portrayal of urban alienation, \"The Night Hawks\" (1942). With the emergence of Abstract Expressionism in the 1940s, Hopper's work was seen as illustrative and obsolete. Pop Art and PhotoComment on works: realism resurrected his reputation. American artist.

      "Introduction": "Kati Horna (May 19, 1912 - October 19, 2000), born Katalin Deutsch, was a Hungarian-born Mexican photojournalist, surrealist photographer and teacher. She was born in Budapest, at the time part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, lived in France, Germany, Spain, and later was naturalized Mexican. Most of her work was considered lost during the Spanish Civil War. She was one of the influential women photographers of her time. Through her photographs she was able to change the way that people viewed war. One way that Horna was able to do this was through the utilization of a strategy called \"gendered witnessing\". Gendered witnessing consisted of putting a feminist view on the notion that war was a predominantly masculine thing.\nHorna became a legendary photographer after taking on a woman's perspective of the war, she was able to focus on the behind-of-the-scenes, which led her to portraying the impact that war had on women and children. One of her most striking images is the T\u00eate de poup\u00e9e (doll's head). Horna worked for various magazines including Mujeres and S.NOB, in which she published a series of f\u00e9tiches, but even her more commercial commissions often contained surreal touches",

Horowitz critically examines the cultures of politics, celebrity, cinema, war, and consumerism. From found footage, Horowitz visually and spatially juxtaposes elements from film, television, and the media to reveal connections and breakdowns between these overlapping modes of communication.In 2005, Horowitz's work Three Rainbow American Flags for Jasper in the Style of the Artist's Boyfriend  made of Oil and Glitter on Linen, depicts a glittery American flag with rainbow stripes.  This work references Jasper Johns' 1958 painting Three Flags .In 2020, Horowitz curated the exhibit We Fight to Build a Free World: An Exhibition by Jonathan Horowitz for The Jewish Museum. Bringing together works by over 70 artists, including Horowitz's own work, \"the exhibition looks at how artists have historically responded to the rise of authoritarianism and xenophobia as well as racism, anti-Semitism, and other forms of bigotry. The exhibition also addresses issues surrounding immigration, assimilation, and cultural identity.\"",
