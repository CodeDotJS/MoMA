He moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1841 and set up a studio. In 1843 Southworth joined Josiah Johnson Hawes in partnership in a Boston daguerreotype studio. In 1846 Southworth photographed the solar eclipse and also took pictures of the moon. Southworth invented a camera for multiple images in 1846-1847. In 1849 he left the partnership with Hawes and travelled to California to seek gold. While in the West he photographed San Francisco, California. In 1851 Southworth became ill and returned to Boston. In 1851 Southworth renewed the partnership with Hawes. In 1856-1857 Southworth conceived the idea of identifying people by means of photography applied to graphology. Auer states that the partnership between Southworth and Hawes was dissolved in 1861-1862, and both became independent photographers in the Boston area; Johnson gives date of dissolution as 1861.",
