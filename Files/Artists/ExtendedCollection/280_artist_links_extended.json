His most acclaimed works include The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums (1939), The Life of Oharu (1952), Ugetsu (1953), and Sansho the Bailiff (1954), with the latter three all being awarded at the Venice International Film Festival. A recurring theme of his films was the oppression of women in historical and contemporary Japan. Together with Akira Kurosawa and Yasujir\u014d Ozu, Mizoguchi is seen as a representative of the \"golden age\" of Japanese cinema.",

Mock was best known for his linocut illustrations that appeared on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times from 1980 through 1996.Born in 1944 in Long Beach, California, Mock earned his bachelor's degree, studying lithography and block printing, at the University of Michigan. Settling in New York City in 1968, Mock had exhibitions at 112 Greene Street, The Whitney (in 1973), Exit Art, and his most recent show at the Sideshow Gallery in Brooklyn. In addition, Mock's art frequently appeared on the covers of the magazines Fifth Estate (Official site: www.FifthEstate.org), Alternative Press Review and Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed. His work has been cited as an influence by a number of contemporary American printmakers, among them Tom Huck and Bill Fick.  Huck and Fick are both members of a group of artists known as the \"Outlaw Printmakers\", which as a collective unit cite Mock's work as one of its main influences.\nMock died on July 28, 2006, after a long illness.",

Her work is noted for its intensity and its blunt, unapologetic humanity, and for the many self-portraits the artist produced, including nude self-portraits. She is considered one of the most important representatives of early expressionism, producing more than 700 paintings and over 1000 drawings during her active painting life.   She is recognized both as the first known woman painter to paint nude self-portraits, and the first woman to have a museum devoted exclusively to her art (the Paula Modersohn-Becker Museum, founded 1927).  Additionally, she is considered to be the first woman artist to depict herself both pregnant and nude and pregnant.Her career was cut short when she died from postpartum embolism at the age of 31.",
