He did not agree with the association of his work with Magic realism or Surrealism, as he said, \"I am after painting reality impressed on the mind so hard that it returns as a dream, but I am not after painting dreams as such, or fantasy.\"  In 1968, he was elected to the National Academy of Design and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.
